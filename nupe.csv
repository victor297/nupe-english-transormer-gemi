ALR These are the ayats of the Book of Wisdom,Alif Lam Ra Wuncinzhi aya yan litafi Alkuranu ayio na yi be hikimae na
Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves- that he should warn mankind of their danger and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth But say the Unbelievers This is indeed an evident sorcerer!,Kashi wunafe eyan mamaki fe ya zawangizhi na Yi yaa wahayi jin ya eza bagi miniabo na kede jin zawangizhi gangba wyo mao ya zanazhia imani jin na labari yangbanfa kede ade kinigiba wanciko yan dzoshi dan eba Tsociabo na Kafirizhi cigan hakika za na na eyan-maci naa tu la na uyio
Verily your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the throne of authority regulating and governing all things No intercessor can plead with Him except after His leave hath been obtained This is Allah your Lord Him therefore serve ye will ye not receive admonition,Hakika Tsoci ye uga yi Sokoo Etsu najin alita sanmazhi to kin dan mini eka yan fo gutsunayino na gancin ucia jin daidai ta eti Alarashio Ucie jin shiri alamarizhi kendoe ga ba una Zandondo danbo naa tangwa wo naa saide be iziniUyin Soko wuncin ga danonao Wyun ga yi Tsoci ye-yeo Ebo acino efe jin bauta yau Kashi ye ewo sinsantu woa
 To Him will be your return- of all of you The promise of Allah is true and sure It is He Who beginneth the process of creation and repeateth it that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness but those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids and a penalty grievous because they did reject Him,Ebau gabo ezhe keba ye dan baeni bo alkawali Soko ma gaskiya uyio Hakika Wyun ga yi Etsu nae ca jin jin alitta nao gancin Ucia kezhe u laazheban zhin Efo Alkiyami ebo u la egagbau ya zanazhia imani jin aci lo tun wan gi zhi na be adalinci zanazhi maajin kafirinci na yi be eyan finci na wona sarauyin na be azaba na tan nae ebo kafirinci nazhi afe jin na
It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light of beauty and measured out stages for her that ye might know the number of years and the count of time Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness Thus doth He explain His Signs in detail for those who understand,Wyun ga la igidi cie ban-nao to etswa nae ya haske na ucia jin be ecin ba zhi ebo yede bae de kpikpe yan lisafi yandondo Soko jin wuncin zhi jina sai de eti gaskiyao Umae kpe ayazhi ye kpe ya zanazhi ga yi eza kpikpe zhi na
 Verily in the alternation of the night and the day and in all that Allah hath created in the heavens and the earth are signs for those who fear Him,Hakika mini cice le ba yan yeshi to igidi to yannazhi Soko jin fi sanmazhio to kin bo na ayazhi danbo ya jamaa nazhi gae sundan Soko acie tswau na
 Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present and those who heed not Our Signs-,Hakika zanazhie sundan yan gun-gun be yi yina na acia yeda jin be emawo izhe na yangbanazhi maashi be uyin na to to zanazhia ya ye ke aya Yizhi lugwa na
Their abode is the Fire because of the evil they earned,Za wuncinzhi kpata ezhe ke baa uga yi enao ebo iri etun dede nazhi afe lo na
Those who believe and work righteousness- their Lord will guide them because of their faith beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss,Hakika zanazhia imani jin na aci lo tun wangizhi na Tsocia wyuna bea bawu be imania yin nuwan jijecizhiafe je fi takoabo fi mini Aljannazhio nazhi yi emi niima na
This will be their cry therein Glory to Thee O Allah! And Peace will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be Praise be to Allah the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!,Aduwa na afe ba fi miniubo na Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya wyoe Soko emi saama miniubo uga yi SALAMUO Aduwa yan zobaama uga yi yebo kpataa jin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata na
If Allah were to hasten for men the ill they have earned as they would fain hasten on the good- then would their respite be settled at once But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us in their trespasses wandering in distraction to and fro,Da aci gan Sokoe din ye din be gwigwo aduwa dede zazhii kendoe wyune dinye be alherii yaana hakika da aga hukunci ba eti ajaliazhi boa ni ebo acino Yi ela zanazhie jin kauna yan gun-gun wangi be Yi yina na ya fi ragbanzhiazhio aci gaazhi fi bo
When trouble toucheth a man He crieth unto Us in all postures- lying down on his side or sitting or standing But when We have solved his trouble he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes!,Kamina egun gaa to za na wyua fe yi Yi ye ci elelebaubo koma edun feubo koma gbaroo Gancin kamina Yi bea egunu laake yabo yau na ufe jin bojin ke wyoa gangan uyi Yi le lo eba egun na tougwa naa na Acinga ga Sokoe la nin pa dan etun nazhi eyan nyincizhi elo nao
Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong their messengers came to them with clear-signs but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin!,Hakika Yi jin alumma nazhi shiyedzo na hallaka lokacina afe jin zwalunci na Tucia zhi ma br yaa be bayanizhi nazhia tu la na amaade ajin imania Acinga ga Yie la egagba ya jamaa nazhi yi le fi jinci zhi nao
 Then We made you heirs in the land after them to see how ye would behave,Gancin Yicia ye laafe khalifazhi kinigici yan alamari Soko zhi dan kin bo zunma yan zanazhi shidzo nao ebo Yii cin ye yele be kendoe ye gaajin jin nae
But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us Say Bring us a reading other than this or change this Say It is not for me of my own accord to change it I follow naught but what is revealed unto me if I were to disobey my Lord I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day to come,Ama gae gba aya Yi nazhia tula na yaa za nazhie jin kauna gungun wangi be Yi yinana ajin agangan La kuranu ndoci beyn najin nanaana koma usangwa Gangan U-- yin ya mi yina umajin kagbo mi yina na mia sanugwa wo be ti mi yin naa Mi mae la mi tu yandondoa sai de natso aga jin wahayiu be yami na Hakika mie sundan migaalr Tsoci mi ba na yan azaba Efo na gbota na
Say If Allah had so willed I should not have rehearsed it to you nor would He have made it known to you A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you will ye not then understandGangan ,Wunaba Soko ba da mia gbau wo ya ye yea da mimaala kpikpeu wu ye woa hakika mi fedun dan tacin yebo eya nazhi dokun na shidzo be dzo kafi wahayiu be na Kashi yeela hankali yezhi la tu alamarizhia
Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against Allah or deny His Signs But never will prosper those who sin,Ngba zii wuye gan za nae tswa ganmana ta Soko nao koma ucia ayauzhi yi ganmana nao Hakika le fi jin ci zhiatso guria
 They serve besides Allah things that hurt them not nor profit them and they say These are our intercessors with Allah Say Do ye indeed inform Allah of something He knows not in the heavens or on earth- Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe to Him!,Acie jin bauta ya yandocizhi ke Soko lugwa yannazhi la egun tsoa woa ama la yandoci anfani jina woa na acie gangan Nanazhi gatangwa yayi eba Soko bo Gangan Beke ye ya Soko labari ya yan yannazhi ukpe yea fi mini sanmazhio to kin bo na Lili kpata ajin tabbata yau be elatui ke yannazhie la pau baci na lugwa
Mankind was but one nation but differed later Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord their differences would have been settled between them,Zawangizhi kpata ma fea saide alumma nini gancin acia cedozhi le ba kaujin ebo egan naashidzo dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo naa da aga hukunci ba tsakaniabo eti yanazhie ce dozhi leba fi minubo na
They say Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord Say The Unseen is only for Allah to know then wait ye I too will wait with you,Acia jin afe gangan kii la aci cin aya zankpe ndoci be yau dagan eba Tsoci u boa yino Gangan Hakika de kpikpe yanna swo kpata na be Soko yinudano Ebo acino efe tu ye mitso dan mini zanazhie tu ye be ye yin na
 When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity hath touched them behold! they take to plotting against Our Signs! Say Swifter to plan is Allah! Verily Our messengers record all the plots that ye make!,Yi ma ga ema yegun laadan zawangio daa emi baci egun na toagwa na kanga wyoa tsuna afe jin makirinci be aya yi yin Gangan Soko din ye gan eba egagba la ya makirinci jincizhi Hakika Tuci yizhi danbo nahzie ka makirinci nazhi ye jin na
He it is Who enableth you to traverse through land and sea so that ye even board ships- they sail with them with a favourable wind and they rejoice thereat then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides and they think they are being overwhelmed they cry unto Allah sincerely offering their duty unto Him saying If thou dost deliver us from this we shall truly show our gratitude!,Wyun ga yi Etsu nae yaye iko zand ta kinbo nao to eti eduzhio na har da kaminaye gaafe mini eya nuwanzhio na acie dazan be ye yin ganni be efe managi acia fe fa yangban beuyin gancin dundufeko ndoci cia be tsun eya wuncin egban yan nuwaanzhi ce fe dina dagan egwa ndondo atso ci ga hakika ya kede hallaka aama kezheani na gancin acia fe yi Soko ye aci ga adinijin tadzu ya Soko gbaugi acia fe gangan Hakika Soko wyo de ga yi wadzun dagan masiba nanao hakika yi gafe dan mini zanazhie jin yebo ya wyo nao
 But when he delivereth them behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right! O mankind! your insolence is against your own souls- an enjoyment of the life of the present in the end to Us is your return and We shall show you the truth of all that ye did,Gancin kamina U bea wadzun zo na acia fe za nazhie jin zwalunci dan kinbo na uma jin be haki ndondo yina Ya ye zawangizhi!

 The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals It grows till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out in beauty the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it There reaches it Our command by night or by day and We make it like a harvest clean-mown as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect,Hakika de kotonci yan edunfe izhe ke nuwan na uyio na Yi duzhin dagan sanmaona gancin yandzo yan kinzhi cia zhinkeba be uyin eyandzo na zwangizhie gi to dabbazhi na harda kamina kin ga eyan wangiuzhi wan sungwa wangi na ucia pa nin na gancin zanazhi wun latina cia fe kpaye gan aga wun iko ta etiubo alaali ma foro yi gae dazan ta etiubo yeshii ko igidi yino gancin Yi ci gau laazhe kin na a yandondou kuani na ke wyoa gan gan ujin wyun ga she be yangici zhi tsuwoanao Acinga ga Yia jin Yi kpe aya zhi ye ya zanazhi gae kpa ye nao
But Allah doth call to the Home of Peace He doth guide whom He pleaseth to a way that is straight,Soko mae yi ye lo emi yan aminciUmae wu zana gaba Una ba lo eko natso yi gboro na
 To those who do right is a goodly reward- Yea more than in measure!

But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil ignominy will cover their faces No defender will they have from the wrath of Allah Their faces will be covered as it were with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night they are companions of the Fire they will abide therein for aye!,Zanazhi ma da cewo etun dedezhi na egagba dede kotonci naace na uga a deo zunyesun be egbae ma gaawangi A de zandondo naa -- a tswa ke azaba Soko lugwa naawyoa ye ganko aba bazhiko yan yeshi ba cia kpea fuskaazhio Zawuncinzhi ga yi zaba enazhio baga bo afi tutun yino

 There will every soul prove the fruits of the deeds it sent before they will be brought back to Allah their rightful Lord and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch,Kanga rayi ndondo otsoa kpe egagba etun nazhi ula shidzo nao aci gaa ku da tsun Soko nayi Ndakataa yan gaskiya na yannazhi ma afe tswa kpata na ci gaa gbinayeo
Say Who is it that sustains you in life from the sky and from the earth or who is it that has power over hearing and sight And who is it that brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living and who is it that rules and regulates all affairs They will soon say Allah Say will ye not then show piety to Him,Gangan Ngba Zie yaye arziki dagan sanmao to kinbo Kashi Zie jin mulki ta eti eganwo yebo to bacin le zhi bo zi maewa eyan be rayi tinya dagan eyan tsutsuci bo umae wa eyan tsutsuci tinya dagan eyan be rayi yino Zi mae jin shiri alamari ndondoo To a gangan Soko To gangan Ngba yega sundan Sokoa

 Thus is the word of thy Lord proved true against those who rebel Verily they will not believe,Acinga ga gaskiya bo yan egan Soko bea tula ta eti fasikizhi bo hakika afe zanazhi jin imania na
Say Of your ´partners´ can any originate creation and repeat it Say It is Allah Who originates creation and repeats it then how are ye deluded away from the truth,Gangan Ngba ade dan mini zanazhi ye la pa Soko bacina na ca jin-jin halitta wo na gancin Uciu la wyunyeujin ba ci ajalio na Gangan Soko gayi Etsu na ca jin jin halitta wo cike ye u jin wo baci ajalionao To kii la acie pan ye ke Soko lugwao
Say Of your ´partners´ is there any that can give any guidance towards truth Say It is Allah Who gives guidance towards truth is then He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed or he who finds not guidance himself unless he is guided what then is the matter with you How judge yeGangan ,Kashi ade mini yannazhi ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa na nae laza ke eko gaskiya wo na Gangan  Soko ga yi Etsu nae laza ke eko gaskiya nao To ngba Etsu nae laza ke eko gaskiya na ga -- yin yin naa gba nao kashi zana laza ke eko woa na sai de aga la wuntso ke eko na To kii dan be ye yino Ke ma ye jin hukunci jin nao
But most of them follow nothing but fancy truly fancy can be of no avail against truth Verily Allah is well aware of all that they do,Ekun dondoazhi ma ade yandocie la mi tua sai de egan tizhi zatozhi egan ti ma zato u kunke wo ya gaskiya be yandondo yina Hakika Soko yi be kpikpe yandondo naafe jin na
 This Qur´an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah on the contrary it is a confirmation of revelations that went before it and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds,Alkuranu na na ma wunaye jin naagau tswa wo umaajin Sokoa naa yina ammade litafi uyio nae wu gaskiya yabo yan litafi nazhi shidzona umae jin bayani hukunci nazhi fi litafio na kelokezhin ndondo danboa dagan eba Etsu nae kpa alitta zhi kpata na bo ufebo
 Or do they say He forged it say Bring then a Sura like unto it and call to your aid anyone you can besides Allah if it be ye speak the truth!Kashi e gan gan wyuntso ga tswa wuno Gan gan Ela sura ni ni kotonci dozhinu beyn ye mae yi zandondo na ye ga de kagbo ayi zunma yan Soko na u beu jin ri wuna yi eza gaskiya ye yio na,
Nay they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass even before the elucidation thereof hath reached them thus did those before them make charges of falsehood but see what was the end of those who did wrong!Aa ade a yanna kpikpea makezhea na yi ganmana bayanizhi ma laa be ya a Acinga ga zanazhi shiadzo na yiu ganmanao Gancin cinle kendoe zoba azwalumi zhi ajin ube yi-yi na,

Among them are some who pretend to listen to thee But canst thou make the deaf to hear- even though they are without understanding,Ama de dan miniabo nazhie shi tukpa ya wyo na Kashi wyo la tukpa tenci wo gan wo ka daama agafe zanazhi de ankalia na
And among them are some who look at thee but canst thou guide the blind- even though they will not see,Ama de dan miniabo naajin ufe cin wyoe le na Kashi wyo la yebonci ke eko wo ka da ma agaafe zanazhie leba yea na
 Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught It is man that wrongs his own soul,Hakika Sokoe jin zawan gi zhi zwalunci be yandondo yina ammade zawangizhiotso gaejin eti tacina zwaluncio
One day He will gather them together It will be as if they had tarried but an hour of a day they will recognise each other assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance,Fona ma uga kuaa yekan na ugafe ke a fedun izhe lea sai de ke yan lokaci ndoci degi igidio na acia kpe dozhi ye kanga Hakika zanazhie gungun be Sokoe yi ganmana na ajin hasara amafe eza bawuzhi
Whether We show thee realised in thy life-time some part of what We promise them- or We take thy soul to Our Mercy Before that- in any case to Us is their return ultimately Allah is witness to all that they do,Ujin-wo ma Yi la sashi yan nazhi Yi jina alkawali na-y- wu wyoe ko ma Yi la rayi wyo yi---to ezhekebaa kpata eba Yibo udano Gancin ma Soko ga yi erio eti yannazhie jin na bo

They say When will this promise come to pass- if ye speak the truth,Amaajin afe gangan focio tso alkawali yan Alkiyamia beo wunayi eza gaskiya zhi ye yio nao
Say I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except as Allah willeth To every people is a term appointed when their term is reached not an hour can they cause delay nor an hour can they advance it in anticipation,Gangan Mi jin mulki wo ya eti tacin mi yan egun naga de mi naa mi made mulki eti eyan anfani boa sai de yanna ga ba Soko ci jin yanuna Alumma ndondo yi be eka ajaliuyin kamina eka ajalia ga kun naa pata yaa yan lokaci ninia amaa la a shidzoa

 Is it not the case that to Allah belongeth whatever is in the heavens and on earth Is it not the case that Allah´s promise is assuredly true Yet most of them understand not,To!

In whatever business thou mayest be and whatever portion thou mayest be reciting from the Qur´an- and whatever deed ye mankind may be doing- We are witnesses thereof when ye are deeply engrossed therein Nor is hidden from thy Lord so much as the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven And not the least and not the greatest of these things but are recorded in a clear record,Be ma kamina wyogafe dan shaani ndondoona to kamin wyo gae gba yandoci dagan mini Alkuranuona ye maa lo dan luilo etundoci boa sai de yi gaafe Erizhi ta eti yebo kamina ye gae lo dan jin jinubo na Tsuwan yan yandoci nayi ke Zarra na na dan kinbo na to na dan sanmaona wuna fangwa ko gbinye ke kpikpe Tsoci wyoe lugwaa To na ga gbagba ganacin na to na ga wancin ganacin na sai de ndondoadan Litafi natsoa tula nao

Relate to them the story of Noah Behold! he said to his people O my people if it be hard on your mind that I should stay with you and commemorate the signs of Allah- yet I put my trust in Allah Get ye then an agreement about your plan and among your partners so your plan be on to you dark and dubious Then pass your sentence on me and give me no respite,Wyo mao gba labari Nuhuo yaa kamina u gan be jamaa yanuzhi gan  Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

Then after him We sent many messengers to their peoples they brought them Clear Signs but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors,Gancin Yici tun Tuci ndocizhi zunmaubo fi jamaa yanazhi a ci be yaa be hujjazhi nazhia tula na afe zanazhia ya gaskiya be yanna ayi ganmana shidzo batsozhio naa Acinga ga Yie la yan te yangban zanazhie gbin iyaka Soko tu nao
 Then after them sent We Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs But they were arrogant they were a people in sin,Gancin zunma yanabo Yici tun Musa be Harunae tun lo eba Firauna to wancinyanuzhi nazhie yau shawara na be aya Yizhi acia gbotika acia fe jamaa nazhi yi lefi jincizhi na
When the Truth did come to them from Us they said This is indeed evident sorcery!,Kamina gaskiya be be yaa dagan eba Yibo na a gan Hakika de nana eyan-ma uyio na yi gbangba na
Said Moses Say ye this about the truth when it hath actually reached you Is sorcery like this But sorcerers will not prosper,Musa ci gan Ye ye gan ya gaskiya kamina ube ebayena gan eyan ma uyio Ngba eyanma ga dan nao Ngan eyan-macizhi maa tso guria
They said Hast thou come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following- in order that thou and thy brother may have greatness in the land But not we shall believe in you!,Aci gan wyo be eba yi be ebo wyo la yiyio pano ke yanna yitsun yanmanci yizhi kpe tiu bo na y lugwa gancin cinwan ciu lauzhe yan ye zagubaaba kpe eti kinbo Yi de ma yia jin imani be egan ye yina

 When the sorcerers came Moses said to them Throw ye what ye wish to throw!,Kamina eyan mancizhi da be zo na Musa cia gan beayin gan E fe ce yandondo yan eyan ma na yegace na
When they had had their throw Moses said What ye have brought is sorcery Allah will surely make it of no effect for Allah prospereth not the work of those who make mischief,To lokaci naa sa ce zo na Musa ci gan yannazhi yebe beyin kpata na eyanma uyio Hakika ma Soko gau nyin ya Hakika Sokoe ye etun zanazhie nyin yan na jina
 And Allah by His words doth prove and establish His truth however much the sinners may hate it!,Soko mae la gaskiya gboka be egan misunuzhi kada ma lefi jincizhi ga navo
 But none believed in Moses except some children of his people because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs lest they should persecute them and certainly Pharaoh was mighty on the earth and one who transgressed all bounds,Gancin ade zanazhi jin imani be egan Musae naa sai de zuriya ndoci dagan mini jamaa yanuzhio ebo dansuno ebo Firauna be wancin yanuzhi be la fitina tswana ma Hakika Firauna wuna gbota dan kinbo umaafe dan mini zanazhi -- iyaka gan be nyin nyin yea na
 Moses said O my people! If ye do really believe in Allah then in Him put your trust if ye submit your will to His,Musa ci gan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! U ga fe gan ye yea imani jin jin ga be Sokoe to yea yakpeu baenio wuna yi musulumizhi yan gaskiya ga yeyio na
They said In Allah do we put out trust Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who practise oppression,Gancin aci gan Soko tsa yi yakpeo Tsoci yan yi! Ga lugwa yi yiafe fitina ya jamaa yan azwalumizhi ma
And deliver us by Thy Mercy from those who reject Thee,Wyo mao la yi yio gan gwa be yegun wyo yin dagan egun jamaa nazhi yi kafirizhi nao
We inspired Moses and his brother with this Message Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt make your dwellings into places of worship and establish regular prayers and give glad tidings to those who believe!,Yici jin wahayi ya musa be yegiu yin kede zagubaba ye e wa edunfeba ya jamaa yan yezhi misrao emi ndocizhio Yemae la emi yezhie zhe ye wu Alkibla yemae la sallae kue gikini wyo mao la labari yangbanfao ya muminizhi
 Moses prayed Our Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of the present and so Our Lord they mislead men from Thy Path Deface our Lord the features of their wealth and send hardness to their hearts so they will not believe until they see the grievous penalty,Musa cigan Ya wyoe Tsoci yi! Hakika wyoga la ninpa izhe be dukyae cia ya Firauna be majalisauzhi dan izhe nanabo ya wyoe Tsoci yi acie lau gbin zawangizhi ke eko wyoe lugwao Ya wyoe Tsoci yi!

Allah said Accepted is your prayer O Moses and Aaron! So stand ye straight and follow not the path of those who know not,Soko ci gan Hakika a aduwa yezhi gwo eboacino yea ku gikini be gaskiyae Ye mae ga lamitu eko yan zanazhi de kpikpea na ma
nce and spite At length when overwhelmed with the flood he said I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in I am of those who submit to Allah in Islam,Yicia Banu Israilazhi patu eduo Firauna be ekun gunciuzhi cia mi tua eti zwaluncio be gbingbintu iyakae har sai na nuwanu wangi na uci gan Mia imani jin kede ade yandondo na ezaawun naa saide Soko na Banu Israilazhi jin imani beyinnae mi maafe dan mini musulumizhio
 We took the Children of Israel across the sea Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite At length when overwhelmed with the flood he said I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in I am of those who submit to Allah in Islam,Yicia Banu Israilazhi patu eduo Firauna be ekun gunciuzhi cia mi tua eti zwaluncio be gbingbintu iyakae har sai na nuwanu wangi na uci gan Mia imani jin kede ade yandondo na ezaawun naa saide Soko na Banu Israilazhi jin imani beyinnae mi maafe dan mini musulumizhio
It was said to him Ah now!- But a little while before wast thou in rebellion!- and thou didst mischief and violence!,Sai gbani! Alalima hakika wyoa le Soko ba leani wyo maafe dan mini zanazhie nyin yan nao
This day shall We save thee in the body that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! but verily many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!,To nyin-na Yi ga nakan kpace ekun wyoe gangwa ebo wyo laofe aya ya zanazhi ga dan zunma wyobona Hakika ma ekundondo zawangizhi e laa yaye ke aya yi zhi lugwa
 We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place and provided for them sustenance of the best it was after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms Verily Allah will judge between them as to the schisms amongst them on the Day of Judgment,Hakika ma yia Banu Israilazhi ya edunfeba edunfeba yan gaskiya Yici yaa arziki dagan mini eyan managizhio Gancin ma a ce lebaa har she na kpikpe dabe yaana Hakika Tsoci wyoe wyunajin hukunci tsakaniabo Efo Alkiyami dan mini yannazhi afe ce dozhi leba etiubo nao
If thou wert in doubt as to what We have revealed unto thee then ask those who have been reading the Book from before thee the Truth hath indeed come to thee from thy Lord so be in no wise of those in doubt,Wyo ma gae jin kelo kezhin jin dan mini yanna Yicinbe ya wyoe nao to gbin zanazhi fe gba Litafi shi wyo dzo na gan Hakika gaskiya da be ya wyoe dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo ebo acino gaafe dan mini zanazhie jin kelokezhin na mao

Nor be of those who reject the signs of Allah or thou shalt be of those who perish,Wyo mao gaafe dan mini zanazhia aya Soko zhi yi ganmana na ma kacana wyo gaafe dan mini eza hasara zhio
Those against whom the word of thy Lord hath been verified would not believe-,Hakika zanazhi egan Sokoajin tabbata ta etiabo naaajin imania
 Even if every Sign was brought unto them- until they see for themselves the penalty grievous,Ka da ma aya ndondo gadabe yaa a jin imania har sai aga azaba tintanci le ye
Why was there not a single township among those We warned which believed- so its faith should have profited it- except the people of Jonah When they believed We removed from them the penalty of ignominy in the life of the present and permitted them to enjoy their life for a while,To ki la acide alkarya ndoci najin imani har imani u ci jinu anfani naa yino sai de jamaa yan yunusao Kamina ajin imani na yia azaba zunyesun yan izhe la keyabo yaa Yici yaa emawo da lokaci ndoci
 If it had been thy Lord´s will they would all have believed- all who are on earth! wilt thou then compel mankind against their will to believe!,Daa cigan uba Tsoci wyo ba da zanazhi dan kinbo kpata na ga imani jin kpataa baenio Kashi wyoa jin zawangizhi kpaka jin na she aga zhe muminizhi na
 No soul can believe except by the will of Allah and He will place doubt or obscurity on those who will not understand,U ma jin kagbo yan rayi ndondo na wyuna jin imani naa sai de be izini Sokoe Soko maajin ula shikan a kpe yangban zanazhi de ankalia na
Say Behold all that is in the heavens and on earth but neither Signs nor Warners profit those who believe not,Gangan E cin le lo eba yannazhi fi sanmazhio to kin bo na Ayazhi ma to gangbazhi a kun-ke ya zanazhi jin imani naa yana
 Do they then expect any thing but what happened in the days of the men who passed away before them Say Wait ye then for I too will wait with you,Kashi yandoci danbo nae tuye na ngan sai de iri efo dede yan zanazhi -- gan shidzo na Gangan E fe tuye!

 In the end We deliver Our messengers and those who believe Thus is it fitting on Our part that We should deliver those who believe!,GancinYiciga Tuci Yizhi gangwa to zanzhia imani jin na acinga gao wunazhe hakki ta eti Yibo na Yi ga muminizhi gangwa na

Say O ye men! If ye are in doubt as to my religion behold! I worship not what ye worship other than Allah! But I worship Allah - Who will take your souls at death I am commanded to be in the ranks of the Believers,Gangan Ya ye zawangizhi!

 And further thus ´set thy face towards religion with true piety and never in any wise be of the Unbelievers,A ma ke gan mi gan wyo mao la mini wyo yo ku ogikini be jin jin adini be gaskiyae wyo mao gaafe dan mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci naoma

If Allah do touch thee with hurt there is none can remove it but He if He do design some benefit for thee there is none can keep back His favour He causeth it to reach whomsoever of His servants He pleaseth And He is the Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Soko ma ga wyo wan be egun ndoci to ade zandondo na lau keya bo na woa sai de wyu tso Soko U ma ga wyo kpa be alheri ndoci zandondo danbo na da eryatwa gwa wo naa Wyune la yan de zana ga bauna mini wuzhiuzhio Wyun ga ma yi Etsu gafarao Etsu yeguno
 Say O ye men!

 Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray,Asha ula tanadiazhi kpaata zo fi egbin boa
And He sent against them Flights of Birds,Soko ci tun jammaa yan elugi nazhi dokun nan fia ganni be azaabae
Striking them with stones of baked clay,Elugi wuncinzhi cie cea takun be enan nana jin be ezun pipoci nan

 And to preach thus ´Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance that He may grant you enjoyment good and true for a term appointed and bestow His abounding grace on all who abound in merit! But if ye turn away then I fear for you the penalty of a great day,Ye mae wa gafara be Tsoci yeyin gancin yemae jin tubae lo ebau wyuna yae emawo nayi wangi na har da lokaci ndoci nayi kpikpeci na uma ga cinwan yan cinwanci ndondo laayau Ye ma ga zunma zheta to hakika mie sundan yaye yan azaba Efo na wancinna
´To Allah is your return and He hath power over all things´,Ezhe keba ye eba Soko bo udano Soko ma Etsu uyio nade iko ta eti yan dondo na
Behold! they fold up their hearts that they may lie hid from Him!

He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the waters - that He might try you which of you is best in conduct But if thou wert to say to them Ye shall indeed be raised up after death the Unbelievers would be sure to say This is nothing but obvious sorcery!,Wyun ga majin alitta sanmazhi be kin-yin dan mini gwargwado fo gutsunayin bo Alarashiu ma wunafe ta eti nuwano ebo ma udebau ma ye yeucinule zii mini yebo e lo tun wangi gano Hakika ma wyo ga gan gan Hakika a gae san baci ajalio hakika zanazhi jin kafirinci na a gangan Nana de ufea sai de eyanma naatula na
 If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term they are sure to say What keeps it back Ah!

Not so do those who show patience and constancy and work righteousness for them is forgiveness of sins and a great reward,Sai de zanazhi ga hakuri jin na aci lo tun wangi wangizhi na Zawuncinzhi gafara be egagba na wancin na gaajin tabatta yaa
Perchance thou mayest feel the inclination to give up a part of what is revealed unto thee and thy heart feeleth straitened lest they say Why is not a treasure sent down unto him or why does not an angel come down with him But thou art there only to warn!

Behold! the Curse of Allah is on those who do wrong!-,Zi ma jin zwalunci kun zana tswa ganmana ta Soko nao za wuncinzhi a kuaku be zhi yegboro Tsociabo erizhi malaikazhi gancin cia gangan Zananazhi ga zunwan ta Tsociaao To emibo yan Soko ajin tabbata ta eti azwalumi zhio
 Those who would hinder men from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked these were they who denied the Hereafter!Zanazhie te eko Sokona acia wa kinkan yau na amaa fe zanazhia jin kafirinci be efo zobaena,
They will in no wise frustrate His design on earth nor have they protectors besides Allah! Their penalty will be doubled! They lost the power to hear and they did not see!Zawuncinzhi afe zanazhia gangwa kinbo naa amaade Ndakata ndocizhi zunma Soko boa ama ga azaba kpe ba dozhi yaa Afe zanazhie wo gan gaskiyaa na amae leu yea,
 They are the ones who have lost their own souls and the fancies they invented have left them in the lurch!,Zawuncinzhi ga yi zanazhia eti tacinazhi jin hasara nao yannazhi ma afe tswa kpata yan gan-ma-nana cia gbina yeo
 Without a doubt these are the very ones who will lose most in the Hereafter!,Kelo kezhin ndondo danboa hakika agaajin hasara gan Efo zoba bo
 But those who believe and work righteousness and humble themselves before their Lord- They will be companions of the gardens to dwell therein for aye!Hakika zanazhi jin imani cia gaskiya ya na aci lo tun wangi wangizhi na acikezhe da kpya ya Tsocia na Zawuncin zhi ga yi egi Aljannazhio Amafi bo fi tutun yin,

 That ye serve none but Allah Verily I do fear for you the penalty of a grievous day,Kede ye ga jin bauta ya yandondo ma hakika mie sundan ya ye yan azaba Efo na yi tin tanci na
 But the chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said We see in thee nothing but a man like ourselves Nor do we see that any follow thee but the meanest among us in judgment immature Nor do we see in you all any merit above us in fact we thing ye are liars!,Wancinzhi nazhia jin kafirinci na mini jamaa yanuzhio na cigan yi de eba yibo zawangi tsa wyo yi dozhin yi yio yi ma le zan do ye na la mitu wyo naa sai de eza gbagban gizhi mini yibo nazhi de rayi ti tacina na yima le ye ye be daraja ndoci-ta ti yiboa yi ye cin le ke ganmana zunci-zhi ye yio na
He said O my people! See ye if it be that I have a Clear Sign from my Lord and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from His own presence but that the Mercy hath been obscured from your sight shall we compel you to accept it when ye are averse to it,Annabi Nuhu cigan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

And O my people! who would help me against Allah if I drove them away Will ye not then take heed,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!zia kangwa wo ya mi be Sokoyino miga-ayan nao Kii-la yecia -- sinsantua yino
 I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah nor do I know what is hidden nor claim I to be an angel Nor yet do I say of those whom your eyes do despise that Allah will not grant them all that is good Allah knoweth best what is in their souls I should if I did indeed be a wrong-doer,Mi maa gan yaye gan edzunba arziki Soko be mi yin udana mi ma de kpikpe yanna Sokoa swo naa mi ma gan ye gan malaika miyia mi maa gan ya zanazhi yegba ye na gan Sokoa la alheri ndoci twarya yaa-woa yina Soko kpe gan be iri yannazhi fi yangbanazhio nao Migajin acin jin da migaafe dan mini azwalumizhio

Of no profit will be my counsel to you much as I desire to give you good counsel if it be that Allah willeth to leave you astray He is your Lord! and to Him will ye return!,Gangba mi ma wunajin ye anfani ndondoa ka miga kpa gan mia jin ye gangba naa ugafe gantun shidzo batsozhio Soko a kpa shibo gan wyun ga ye gbin na wyun ga yi Tsoci ye yeo ebau gama ala ye zheban lo

Or do they say He has forged it Say If I had forged it on me were my sin! and I am free of the sins of which ye are guilty!,Kashi egangan gan wyuntso tswau tswa Gangan ka wun ayi gan mi tswau tswa ngan lefi wuncin eti mitso bo wunatao mi ma egwa mi wa be etun lefi nazhi yetsoe lo na
It was revealed to Noah None of thy people will believe except those who have believed already! So grieve no longer over their evil deeds,Ama jin wahayi ya Annabi Nuhu kede ade zandondo naajin imani mini jamaa yan wyozhio be naa sai de nazhi ga imani jin leani na Ebo acino wyo ga nyin yangban be iri etun nazhi agae lo na ma
But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration and address Me no further on behalf of those who are in sin for they are about to be overwhelmed in the Flood,Wyo mao la eya nuwano kan be ye Yi yin be wahayi Yi yin wyo mao ga gan yandondo be mi yin eti kafirizhio ma Hakika agbina gbin fi nuwano
 Forthwith he starts constructing the Ark Every time that the chiefs of his people passed by him they threw ridicule on him He said If ye ridicule us now we in our turn can look down on you with ridicule likewise!,Ucia ca eya nuwan-yn kan kandondo na ma wancin zhi mini jamaa yanuzhio gabe -- gan na ajin afe lau mi Uci gan ye ga la yi mi to yitsoa be lae mi kendoe yee la yi mi na
But soon will ye know who it is on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame- on whom will be unloosed a penalty lasting,Bele yin yea be kpe zana azaba yan zunyesun gaa be ya na to za na azaba na ga fedun na cia gaa ta na
At length behold! there came Our command and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said Embark therein of each kind two male and female and your family - except those against whom the word has already gone forth- and the Believers but only a few believed with him,Har da kamina foro Yi da be na Misun nuwan eduzhi cia la Yici gan A eba be yiwoe dagan mini alitta ndondo ku fi bo ganni be iyali wyozhi sai de zana hukunci Soko gaa shidzo ta eti ubo to zana ga gaskiya yana to atso alaaku ama jin imani beuyina sai eza degi
So he said Embark ye on the Ark In the name of Allah whether it move or be at rest! For my Lord is be sure Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful!,Uci gan Egandan miniubo be sunna Sokoe Bismillahi ga yi ezanda wuno wyun ga ma yi kinigi wuno Hakika Tsoci mi Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
 So the Ark floated with them on the waves towering like mountains and Noah called out to his son who had separated himself from the rest O my son! embark with us and be not with the unbelievers!,Uci fe dazan bea yin dan mini edu nae je cia fe ke pati na Nuhu ci fe ta midan egiu kananu kan-ga ma wyuna kpe ya ci dagi bandocio uci gan ya wyoe egi mi!

 The son replied I will betake myself to some mountain it will save me from the water Noah said This day nothing can save from the command of Allah any but those on whom He hath mercy! And the waves came between them and the son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood,Egi cigan Ngan mi ga gadan nin yan pati ndocio naa kan gwa ya mi be nuwane na Annabi Nuhu ci gan yandondo danbo yinna naa kangwa ya za dagan alamari Sokoo naaa sai de zana Sokoa gunyeu na egban nuwan cia fe dan tsakaniabo be dozhi ucia fe dan mini zanazhia gbin fi nuwano na
 Then the word went forth O earth! swallow up thy water and O sky! Withhold thy rain! and the water abated and the matter was ended The Ark rested on Mount Judi and the word went forth Away with those who do wrong!Aci gan ya wyoe kin! Anuwan wyo nyin to wyo tso sanma anuwao kanfi Nuwan ma cia kan ta hukunci na Soko bana cia jin tabbata eya cia kan gikini pati ndocio ucia jin daidai ta pati nae yigan JUDIYU na aci gan kpikpeya be rahma Sokoe wunajin tabbata ya azwalumizhi,
 And Noah called upon his Lord and said O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true and Thou art the justest of Judges!,Nuhu ci yi Tsociuye uci gan ya wyoe Tsoci mi! hakika egi mi dan mini iyali mizhio hakika ma alkawali wyo ma gaskiyauyio wyo ga ma man hukunci jin gan zandondo
He said O Noah! He is not of thy family For his conduct is unrighteous So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel lest thou act like the ignorant!,Soko ci gan Ya wyoe Nuhu!

Noah said O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee lest I ask Thee for that of which I have no knowledge And unless thou forgive me and have Mercy on me I should indeed be lost!,U gan Tsoci mi hakika mie ba tswitswa be wyo yin na mia gbin wyo gan yan na mide hakika wuna be na kagan wyo fa be mi yin wyoci gun mi yea to migafedan mini hasara jinci zhio
The word came O Noah! Come down from the Ark with peace from Us and blessing on thee and on some of the peoples who will spring from those with thee but there will be other peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures for a time but in the end will a grievous penalty reach them from Us,Acigan ya wyoe Nuhu acin be aminci dagan eba yibo be albarkazhi ta eti wyobo be alumma nazhi dan ganni be wyo yin nae Alumma ndocizhi ma danbo yia yaa emanwo degi gancin azaba na tan sarauyin na dagan eba Yibo cia toa gwa
Such are some of the stories of the unseen which We have revealed unto thee before this neither thou nor thy people knew them So persevere patiently for the End is for those who are righteous,Wuncizhi dan mini labari gaibuzhi swiswocizhi na yiejin wahayia ya wyo na Ebona to wyoe to jamaa yan wyozhi a kpeuye shiboa ebo acino a hankuri jin hakika zoba wangi gajin tabbata ya za nazhie sundan Soko acie tswau na
 To the ´Ad People We sent Hud one of their own brethren He said O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him Your other gods ye do nothing but invent!,Be ma Yitun zafi aduzhi yegiatso nae ye Hudu na uci gan ya ye jama yan mizhi! Ejin bauta ya Soko yede Tsoci ndoci zunmauboa yede fea saide za nazhie tswa ganmana zhina
O my people! I ask of you no reward for this Message My reward is from none but Him who created me Will ye not then understand,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! Mi gbinye gan egagba ndondo eti etun na mielo na boa egagba mide udan be Etsu na ca jin jin alitta mi na kashi yede hankali de a
 And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain and add strength to your strength so turn ye not back in sin!,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! Ewa gafara be Tsoci ye yin gancin yemae jin tubae lo ebau wyuna dule nadokun na be yaye dagan sanmao umaa kezhe be kagbo ta eti kagbo yebo yemae ga zhe zunma tayea zhe leifi jincizhi na ma
They said O Hud! No Clear Sign that hast thou brought us and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee!,Aci gan ya wyoe Hudu! Wyo be ya yi be hujja ndondo yina yi maa lu kutiyizhi gwa ebo egan wyoboa Yimaa ya gaskiya be wyo yina
 We say nothing but that perhaps some of our gods may have seized thee with imbecility He said I call Allah to witness and do ye bear witness that I am free from the sin of ascribing to Him,Yide de yandociagana saide yie leye gan sashi yan kuti yizhi dea wyo togwa be egun ndoci-ebo toko na wyoe gia na Ugan Mie yi Soko Eri yetso mae jin ri kede hakika mia egwa mi wa be yannazhi ye laapa Soko baci nae
Other gods as partners! so scheme your worst against me all of you and give me no respite,Yandoci na jin Sokoa na ye mae la makirinci yezhie pa eti mibo ye mae ga pata ya mi ma
I put my trust in Allah My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature but He hath grasp of its fore-lock Verily it is my Lord that is on a straight Path,Hakika mia yakpe Soko nayi Tsoci mi Uma yi Tsoci ye na ade yandoci nae dazan ta eti kinbo naa sai de kokontsoko alamariu kpata dan egwa zankpe Soko Hakika Tsoci mi ta eti ekpa natso yi gboro na
If ye turn away- I at least have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you My Lord will make another people to succeed you and you will not harm Him in the least For my Lord hath care and watch over all things,To ye ma ga zunma zhe ta hakika de mia yan wu ya ye yan yanna a tun mi fi ye naTsoci mima san ye gwa wo be jamaa ndocizhi kayin ye ma la egun ndondo tswanu woa Hakika Tsoci mi Etsu uyio nae tswa yandondo na
So when Our decree issued We saved Hud and those who believed with him by special Grace from Ourselves We saved them from a severe penalty,Kamina foro yi da be na yia Annabi Hudu gangwa to zanazhi jin imani beu yin na wuncin ma yi yegun dagan eba yi bo Yicia gangwa dagan azaba na lekpan na
Such were the ´Ad People they rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher disobeyed His messengers And followed the command of every powerful obstinate transgressor,Zawuncinzhi ma agayi Aduzhio nazhi gbomi be aya Tsocia zhi na acia le Tuciuzhi ba na acia mi tu foro zadondo na yi eti kagbo ci naakan ke eko guru lugwa na
And they were pursued by a Curse in this life- and on the Day of Judgment Ah! Behold! for the ´Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed from sight were ´Ad the people of Hud!,Acia mi tua izhe nanao be emiboe to Alkiyamio Acinga gao! Hakika aduzhia ajin kafirinci be Tsocia yin Hakika emibo ajin tabbata ya Adu jamaa yan Hudu zhi
 To the Thamud People We sent Salih one of their own brethren He said O my people! Worship Allah ye have no other god but Him It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein then ask forgiveness of Him and turn to Him in repentance for my Lord is always near ready to answer,Acinga ma yi tun Tuci fi samudawa zhi Salihu na yi yegiatso na Ugan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

 They said O Salih! thou hast been of us! a centre of our hopes hitherto! dost thou now forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped But we are really in suspicious disquieting doubt as to that to which thou invitest us,Aci gan ya wyoe Salihu!

 He said O my people! do ye see if I have a Clear Sign from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself- who then can help me against Allah if I were to disobey Him What then would ye add to my portion but perdition,Ugan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you leave her to feed on Allah´s free earth and inflict no harm on her or a swift penalty will seize you!,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

When Our Decree issued We saved Salih and those who believed with him by special Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day For thy Lord - He is the Strong One and able to enforce His Will,Kamina foro azaba yi da be na yia Annabi Salihu wadzun to zanazhia imani jin beuyin na be yegun dagan eba Yibo yia wadzun dagan zun ye sun yan fowuncino Hakika Tsoci wyoe wyun ga yi Etsu kagbo wyun gayi Etsu zankpeo

There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings They said Peace! He answered Peace! and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf,Hakika ma Tuci Yizhi be eba Ibrahima be bushara yangbanfae aci gan Aminci ulaujin tabbatau ya wyoe uci gan Aminci ulaujin tabbatau ya yetso Ufeduna sai na ube yaa be so ya nakan nankoe na

But when he saw their hands went not towards the meal he felt some mistrust of them and conceived a fear of them They said Fear not We have been sent against the people of Lut,To kamina u leye gan egwaazhi tun evo soyaa na fe naa vo uci fe wo dansuna dan yanbgano aci gan Ga sundan ma hakika yi a tun yi tunfi jamaa yan Annabi Lutuzhi
 And his wife was standing there and she laughed But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac and after him of Jacob,Yinmiu magi gbaro kanga uci matsan Yici fau yangban be egi mae Ishakuy zunma Ishakuo be wyunama Yaakubu
She said Alas for me! shall I bear a child seeing I am an old woman and my husband here is an old man That would indeed be a wonderful thing!,Yinmiu ci gan kasa mi re Ngba mia magi mi maa kuku eba mitso ma dan na wyuntsoa kuku ma Hakika nana eyan mamaki uyio

 When fear had passed from the mind of Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him he began to plead with us for Lut´s people,Kamina dansun be a la ke yabo ya Ibrahim na labari yangban fa cida be yau na ufe dingan be Yi yin eti alamari jamaa yan Lutuzhio
 For Abraham was without doubt forbearing of faults compassionate and given to look to Allah,Hakika Ibrahima eza hakuri uyio zanae dokun be ekpedae na uyio zana mae dokun be ezheban lo eba Soko na uyio
O Abraham! Seek not this The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth for them there cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back!,Ya wyoe Ibrahima a pan-ya ke nana lugwa Hakika alamari Tsoci wyoe da bea ni Hakika ma azaba naa ye dagwa yaa na a da be yaa
When Our messengers came to Lut he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless to protect them He said This is a distressful day,Kamina Tuci Yizhi tun eba Lutu na uu nyin yangban eboabo yangbana cia yiku uci gan Nana efo uyio nade ezo sarauyin na
And his people came rushing towards him and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations He said O my people! Here are my daughters they are purer for you if ye marry! Now fear Allah and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man,Jamaa yanuzhi ci dabe ebau a fe dinye shidzo batso zhio a fe zanazhi fe lo tun dedezhi na Ugan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

 The Messengers said O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains and let not any of you look back but thy wife will remain behind To her will happen what happens to the people Morning is their time appointed Is not the morning nigh,Egauzhi ci gan ya wyoe Lutu!

To the Madyan People We sent Shu´aib one of their own brethren he said O my people! worship Allah Ye have no other god but Him And give not short measure or weight I see you in prosperity but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will compass you all round,Yima tun Tuci fi jamaa yan Madyanazhi ugayi yegiatso Annabi Shuaybuo ugan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

They said O Shu´aib! Does thy religion of prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practised or that we leave off doing what we like with our property truly thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded!,Acigan ya wyoe Shuaybu!

He said O my people! see ye whether I have a Clear Sign from my Lord and He hath given me sustenance pure and good as from Himself I wish not in opposition to you to do that which I forbid you to do I only desire your betterment to the best of my power and my success in my task can only come from Allah In Him I trust and unto Him I look,Ugan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

But ask forgiveness of your Lord and turn unto Him in repentance For my Lord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness,Ye mae wa gafara Tsoci ye gancin ye mae jin tubae lo ebau Hakika Tsoci mi Etsu yegun uyio Etsu boye uyio
 They said O Shu´aib! much of what thou sayest we do not understand! In fact among us we see that thou hast no strength!

And O my people!

 When Our decree issued We saved Shu´aib and those who believed with him by special mercy from Ourselves But the mighty blast did seize the wrong-doers and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning-,Kamina foro Yi be na Yia Shuaybu gangwa be zanazhi jin imani ganna beu uyin na be yegun ndoci dagan eba yibo kabara ko ndoci cia zanazhi jin zwalunci na wan acia tinba fi emiazhio ajin hallaka kpe eti vokpaazhio
 As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! Ah! Behold! How the Madyan were removed from sight as were removed the Thamud!,Wyoa ye gan ko alafedun fi emiazhio lea Acinga gao kpikpe ya be yegun Sokoe wunajin tabbata ya Madyana cizhi kendoe Samuduzhi kpeya be yegun Sokoe na
And we sent Moses with Our Clear Signs and an authority manifest,Hakika ma yi tun Musa tun be aya Yizhi ganni be hujjazhi nazhi yi gbangba na
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs but they followed the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was no right guide,Lo eba Firauna be waziriuzhi acia mitu foro Firauna foro Firauna kpata ma ta eti ekpa gboro boa
 He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment and lead them into the Fire as cattle are led to water But woeful indeed will be the place to which they are led!,Wyuna shi jamaa yanuzhidzo Efo Alkiyamio ucia kpana ya da fi enao Kpinkpan fi danna iri nanao ma wuna bi ye
And they are followed by a curse in this life and on the Day of Judgment and woeful is the gift which shall be given unto them!,Acia mi tua izhe nanao be laanae emiboe to Alkiyamio Iri eryatwa nana naa twaana maa bi ye
These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee of them some are standing and some have been mown down by the sickle of time,Wuncinzhi kpata dan mini etan alkaryazhio na yie gba ya wyo na Miniabo ade nazhi yi gi gbaro na amade nazhia gbin yaa ni na
It was not We that wronged them They wronged their own souls the deities other than Allah whom they invoked profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord Nor did they add aught to their lot but perdition!,Yima jina zwaluncia amaade atso tsa jin ti tacina zwaluncio Tsociazhi nazhi ma ejin bauta ya na ma kunke yaa wo be yandondoe kamina alamari azaba Soko be yaa naa Abea yandondo-otsoa sai de hallaka
Such is the chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in the midst of their wrong grievous indeed and severe is His chastisement,Acinga ga ma winwan yan Tsoci wyo yio kamina uga Alkarya ndoci wan kamina agajin kafirinci acie jin zwalunci na Hakika win wan yan Soko yanna tan na uyi sarauyino
In that is a Sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter that is a Day for which mankind will be gathered together that will be a Day of Testimony,Hakika mini wuncino aya danbo nae wugwa zankpe Soko na ya zandondo na gae sundan azaba Efo zoba na Fo wuncin ma Efo uyio naaga zandondo kuyekan na Efo ma uyio na zandondo a jin ri na
 Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed,Yima pauta paa sai de ebo lokaci na yi bibaci na
The day it arrives no soul shall speak except by His leave of those gathered some will be wretched and some will be blessed,Efo na ugaa be na ade rayi naa gan gan naa sai de be izini Sokoe To ade dan mini zawangizhio foga nazhi yi shakizhi na amade nazhi yi eza ti manaci zhi na
Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire There will be for them therein nothing but the heaving of sighs and sobs,Amaade zanazhi yi shakki-zhi na to a yea fi enao yanna a fe jin fi bo na uga yi kabara yi elo be zhin yino
They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure except as thy Lord willeth for thy Lord is the sure accomplisher of what He planneth,Amaa fi bo tutun yin gwargwado yan dindanbo yan sanmazhi be kinyin sai de yanna ga ke be ba Tsoci wyoe ci jin yanuna Hakika Tsoci wyoe yanna ga bauna wunejino
And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure except as thy Lord willeth a gift without break,Amaade zanazhi yi eza ti manancizhi na to a fi mini Aljannao tutunyin matuka yan dindanbo sanmazhi to kin sai de yanna ga be ba Soko na Nanama eryatwa uyio naa baa na
Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before them but verily We shall pay them back in full their portion without the least abatement,Wyo mao gaa fedan mini kelo kezhino eti yannazhi za nanazhie jin bauta ya na ma Ajin bauta ya yandondoa sai de yanna yanma ciazhi fe jin bauta ya shidzo batsozhio na Yimaga egagbaazhi shekpan yaa yan azaba naa dina na
We certainly gave the Book to Moses but differences arose therein had it not been that a word had gone forth before from thy Lord the matter would have been decided between them but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it,Hakika ma Yila Litafi ya Musa acia ce le ba dan mini ubo kagan umajin ebo kalma ndoci naashi dzo dagan eba Tsoci wyo na boa da hakika aga hukunci jin tsakaniabo a ni Hakika ma afe dan mini kelokezhin nae la yangbanazhi cie ceka za na
 And of a surety to all will your Lord pay back in full the recompense of their deeds for He knoweth well all that they do,Hakika ma zaeni ndondo miniabo sai de Tsoci wyoe gaa gagba yan etun nazhi a lona Hakika Soko yi be labari etun nazhia lo kpata na
Therefore stand firm in the straight Path as thou art commanded- thou and those who with thee turn unto Allah and transgress not from the Path for He seeth well all that ye do,Wyomao lao kuo gikini kendoe Soko jin wyoe umurni na to wyoe to zanazhi ga tuba jin ganni be wyo yin na ye mae ga -- iyaka ganma Hakika Sokoe le yannazhi ye jin na ye
 And incline not to those who do wrong or the Fire will seize you and ye have no protectors other than Allah nor shall ye be helped,Ye maega ya kansan lo eba azwalumizhi ma kacina enaa poe ye made Ndakata ndocizhi zunma Soko boa gancin ma ade taimako ndondo naajin ye naa
 And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night For those things that are good remove those that are evil Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember their Lord,Wyo mao la sallao kuo gikini caba igidio to zobau yin to caba yan yeshi Hakika etun wangizhi e la dedezhi fin ya Wuncin ma sinsantu uyio ya zanazhi gae gwo sinsantu na
 And be steadfast in patience for verily Allah will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish,Wyo mao la hankurio jin ebo na hakika Sokoe ta lada za guruzhi yakpe
And be steadfast in patience for verily Allah will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish,Wyo mao la hankurio jin ebo na hakika Sokoe ta lada za guruzhi yakpe
Why were there not among the generations before you persons possessed of balanced good sense prohibiting men from mischief in the earth - except a few among them whom We saved from harm But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoyment of the good things of life which were given them and persisted in sin,E gangan ade eza kiriki ndocizhi mini alumma nazhi shiyedzo naboa nazhia fe kan luilo etun dedezhi kinbo naa Sai de eza degi nazhia de dagan mini zanazhi yi wadzun miniabo na Zanazhi maazhe azwalumizhi na ma amitu eman yan ba-- naajin yaa na acia fe lefi jinci zhi
 Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrong-doing if its members were likely to mend,Tsoci wyoe maejin alkarya ndoci hallaka eti zwalunci boa alaali ma za kin wuncinzhi mayi za kirki zhia
If thy Lord had so willed He could have made mankind one people but they will not cease to disputeUma ga ba Tsoci wyo ba da uga zawangizhi kpata laafe alumma nini amaa kuke ya boa afe celeba dozhi,
Except those on whom thy Lord hath bestowed His Mercy and for this did He create them and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled I will fill Hell with jinns and men all together,Sai de za na Tsoci wyoe ga gun yeu na Eti wuncin gabo ma ujin ao Egan Tsoci wyo maajin tabbata kede Hakika mi ga jahannama she be aljanuzhi to zawangizhi bae nio na
All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers- with it We make firm thy heart in them there cometh to thee the Truth as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe,Kpata ma Yie ya wyoe labari ya dagan mini labari Tuci zhio na yi gaashi wyoe yangban ta na Gaskiya ma da be ya wyoe dan mini Litafi nanao to waazi to sinsantu ya muminizhi
Say to those who do not believe Do what ever ye can We shall do our partWyo mao gano ya zanazhi jin imaniana gan Efe lo tun eti kinigi ba yezhio hakika yi tsoe lotun ma,
And wait ye! We too shall waitYe mae fe tu ye hakika to yitsoe tu ye ma,
 To Allah do belong the unseen secrets of the heavens and the earth and to Him goeth back every affair for decision then worship Him and put thy trust in Him and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do ,Soko gama wun yannazhi swo fi sanmazhio to kinbo nao alamari kpata ma ebau ga aa kezhe lo E bo acino jin bauta yau wyo mao lao yaokpeu Tsoci wyoma yaye eti etun nazhie lo na boa
 We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur´an in order that ye may learn wisdom,Hakika Yi ga cinu beo Alkuranu uyio be zhimi larabci ujin wo be gbigba uyin ye gaade hankali
We do relate unto thee the most beautiful of stories in that We reveal to thee this portion of the Qur´an before this thou too was among those who knew it not,Yi gaa ya wyoe labari etan na gyegan nao be iri wahayi na yi jin ya wyoe be Alkuranu nanae na Hakika ma wyoa fe shidzo kafi Alkuranu na wyo dan mini zanazhi de kpikpe wuna na
Behold! Joseph said to his father O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon I saw them prostrate themselves to me!,Wyo mao pa kamina Annabi Yusufu gangan ya babau na Ya wyoe baba mi! Hakika mi lr tswangi guwo beni ye to igidi to etswa mi lea ye afejin sujada ya mi
 Said the father My dear little son! relate not thy vision to thy brothers lest they concoct a plot against thee for Satan is to man an avowed enemy!,Ugan Ya wyoe egimi! G a la labari ena na wyo na-na ya yegi wyozhi ma kacina a jin tanadi dede ya wyoe Hakika shetan makiri u yio naatula na ya zawangi
 Thus will thy Lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of stories and events and perfect His favour to thee and to the posterity of Jacob - even as He perfected it to thy fathers Abraham and Isaac aforetime! for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom,Be acingae gama Tsoci wyoe wyuna tsa wyo yo umaa wu wye kpikpe fasara enazhio uma ga niimau shekpan ya wyoe to iyali Yakubu zhi kendoe ulau shekpan ya yanmanci wyozhi guba ba na a gayi Ibrahima be Ishaka yino Hakika Tsoci wyoe Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs or symbols for seekers after Truth,Hakika ayazhi dan bo nazhie wugwa zankpe Soko na dan labari Yusufuo be yegiuzhi ya za nazhi gae gbin gan na
 They said Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we But we are a goodly body! really our father is obviously wandering in his mind!,Wyo mao pa kamina a gangan Hakika baba yi yebo Yusufu be yegiu yin yi Yima dan na jamaa nadokun na Hakika baba yi dan mini bicicino naa tula na
 Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some unknown land that so the favour of your father may be given to you alone there will be time enough for you to be righteous after that!,Yea Yusufu wu koma yeu ce da kin ndoci ye ga jin acin fuska baba ye gaazhe zhin eba ye ye ma gaazhe eza kirikizhi zunmau bo
Said one of them Slay not Joseph but if ye must do something throw him down to the bottom of the well he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers,Egan ganci ndoci miniabo cigan Ega wu Yusufu ma ye deu ce gun gushe zhiko yan -- gao kodagba nazhie dazan za naabe deu la ugaa ye ye gan acinga yea jino na
 They said O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph- seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers,Aci gan Ya wyoe babayi! Kiilaotso wyo cie ya yi gaskiya eti egan Yusufu boa yino Alaalima yi zanazhia tswau na yi yio
 Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play and we shall take every care of him,Uu laadan mini yibo esun udau kpa dabbazhi umau dzodzo hakika za nazhia fe tswauna yi yio
Jacob said Really it saddens me that ye should take him away I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him,Ugan Hakika luilo ye beu yin wuna nyin mi yangban mi mae sundan ye be da yau ye har makundunu beu wangi ma
 They said If the wolf were to devour him while we are so large a party then should we indeed first have perished ourselves!,Agan Hakika ma makundunu gau wangi yi mazhina jamaa nazhi gboka na uga bea fe acin hakika yi yia zunya
So they did take him away and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well and We put into his heart this Message ´Of a surety thou shalt one day tell them the truth of this their affair while they know thee not´,To kamina a be da beu yin na a emi gun eti de a la wyuna ceagun gushe zhiko yan -- gao yi ma jin wahayi yau gan Wallahi fondoci wyoa be yaa labari alamari naadan y ninbo daa na alaali ma a kpe gan acinga Sokoa jnia
Then they came to their father in the early part of the night weepingAci dazhin eba babaazhi lokaci ishae aci fe ti gi,
 They said O our father! We went racing with one another and left Joseph with our things and the wolf devoured him But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth,Agan Ya wyoe babayi! Hakika yida bana yi fe da dzodzo yan eci bi gan na sa na yicia Yusufu ci eba karayi zhio makundunu ci beu wagi Wyo maa yayi gaskiyaa kadaa ma wyunayi gaskiya taci zhi yi yio na
They stained his shirt with false blood He said Nay but your minds have made up a tale that may pass with you for me patience is most fitting Against that which ye assert it is Allah alone Whose help can be sought,Aci be be egya ganmanae dan ewoubo Babaa ci gan ujinacina yangban ye de wuna alamari ndoci pa yaye Ebo acino mide yandocia jina sai de hakuri natso yi wangi na Soko ga mayi Etsu na mia wa taimako be yin eti bojin nazhi ye jin nao
 Then there came a caravan of travellers they sent their water-carrier for water and he let down his bucket into the wellHe said Ah there! Good news! Here is a fine young man! So they concealed him as a treasure! But Allah knoweth well all that they do!,Lokaci na kodagba ndocizhi be naa zaeni tun naada wa nuwan be yaa na ucia evo -- gau ce gun -- gao uci gan E yan yangbanfa dan na re!

The Brethren sold him for a miserable price for a few dirhams counted out in such low estimation did they hold him!,Aciu kun kpwakpwa be ewo dirhami nayi bibici na Acia fe za nazhie wo ninfu be eyan degi etiubo na
The man in Egypt who bought him said to his wife Make his stay among us honourable may be he will bring us much good or we shall adopt him as a son Thus did We establish Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of stories and events And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs but most among mankind know it not,Za nama shiu dagan Masario misra na cia gan ya yin iu gan A gwa sunu be boloboloe ujin wo ulau fe anfaniu ya yi koma yi la wyunyla egi Soko gan Be acingae ga yi la kinigi ba ya Yusufu ta ti kinbo ebona ma yi wuu fasara yan enazhi na Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio dan mini alamariu bo amaade ekundondo zawangizhi a kpea
 When Joseph attained His full manhood We gave him power and knowledge thus do We reward those who do right,Kamina u bea kun za ciajin baligi na Yi ciu ya hikima be ilimi Acinga ga Yie la egagba ya zanazhi gae jin bolo-bolo nao
 But she in whose house he was sought to seduce him from his true self she fastened the doors and said Now come thou dear one! He said Allah forbid! truly thy husband is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!,Yinzagi na ma ugun kataubo na ci wau na wyuntsoa keba be wyun yin na ucia ekozhi tsu gbanyin uci gan To wyo ye be! Ugan Sokou gwo miu tswa! Hakika eba wyoe ndakata mi uyio umaa mi ya ecinba wangi Hakika azwalumizhia de roboa
And with passion did she desire him and he would have desired her but that he saw the evidence of his Lord thus did We order that We might turn away from him all evil and shameful deeds for he was one of Our servants sincere and purified,Hakika ma wyunI yinzagi ujin kokari na wyuna dinu be lo tun dede na wyun tso Yusufu ma jin kokari na wyunanavo na kagan ujin ebo hujjako yan Tsociu na u le ye naa hujjako Annabci na Soko la yai na Acinga ga Yi la dalilizhi wu wyuno ebo Yiila etun dede be etun swakwaey kangway-yau Hakika udan mini wuzhi Yi zhi nazhi yi zakirikizhi na
So they both raced each other to the door and she tore his shirt from the back they both found her lord near the door She said What is the fitting punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife but prison or a grievous chastisement,Aci sangana be ci lo eba kpako ewouma cia le dagan zunmao aci da keba kpamyin be ebauyin eba kpako wyun yinzagi ci gan Egagba ndoci danbo ya zandondo nagae kpa eyan dede be iyali wyo yin naa sai de ala wyuna wanakanadan koma a jinu azaba na tan na
So they both raced each other to the door and she tore his shirt from the back they both found her lord near the door She said What is the fitting punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife but prison or a grievous chastisement,Aci sangana be ci lo eba kpako ewouma cia le dagan zunmao aci da keba kpamyin be ebauyin eba kpako wyun yinzagi ci gan Egagba ndoci danbo ya zandondo nagae kpa eyan dede be iyali wyo yin naa sai de ala wyuna wanakanadan koma a jinu azaba na tan na
 He said It was she that sought to seduce me - from my true self And one of her household saw this and bore witness thus- If it be that his shirt is rent from the front then is her tale true and he is a liar!,Annabi Yusufu ci gan Wyun tso ga wa mi yino Eri jinci ndoci dzakangi mini yegiuzhio ci jin ri gan Ewou gaafe lileci dagan yegboro to wyin y nyizagiade gaskiya Wyin bagi maafe dan mini ganmana zunci zhio
But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back then is she the liar and he is telling the truth!,E wou ma gafe lileci zunmao to wyiny yinzagi a ganmana zun wyin y bagi mafe dan mini eza gaskiyazhio
 So when he saw his shirt- that it was torn at the back- her husband said Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly mighty is your snare!,Kamina ebau be le ye gan a leu ewo le dagan zunmao na ugan Nana de udan mini tanadi ye ynzagizhio hakika ma tanadiye ynzagizhi yanna gbota uyio
 O Joseph pass this over! O wife ask forgiveness for thy sin for truly thou hast been at fault!,Wyoe Yusufu! Dzungan egan ynzagi nanao wyo ma yinmi mi da wa gafara lefi wyoe Hakika wyo afe dan mini bicicin cizhio
 Ladies said in the City The wife of the great ´Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his true self Truly hath he inspired her with violent love we see she is evidently going astray,Ynzagi ndocizhi dagan ezhininbo ci gan Yinmi eza cinwanci e wa yanciuuda be egi katau yin legen lege cincin wuna rukpeu yangbano Hakika yi ye le uye dan mini egbino naatu la na
Ladies said in the City The wife of the great ´Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his true self Truly hath he inspired her with violent love we see she is evidently going astray,Ynzagi ndocizhi dagan ezhininbo ci gan Yinmi eza cinwanci e wa yanciuuda be egi katau yin legen lege cincin wuna rukpeu yangbano Hakika yi ye le uye dan mini egbino naatu la na
When she heard of their malicious talk she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them she gave each of them a knife and she said to Joseph Come out before them When they saw him they did extol him and in their amazement cut their hands they said Allah preserve us! no mortal is this! this is none other than a noble angel!,Kaminaube wo egan wawagi yan makirinci nae gan na uci tun za fia gan wyune yanaka ucia shiri jin yaa yan edunfeba yangici ucia ebi laa ya zaeni ndondo miniabo ucia gan be Annabi YusufuI gan Dzun tinya wyo -- ogan yegboroa bo Kamina a leu ye na uu wancin acia egwaatso zhi ba aci gan Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko!

She said There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I did seek to seduce him from his true self but he did firmly save himself guiltless!and now if he doth not my bidding he shall certainly be cast into prison and what is more be of the company of the vilest!,Ugan Zawuncin ga danona na ye fe jin mi zargi etiubo na hakika ma mi wau ga ucia navo Wallahi ma kagan ujin yanna mi jinu foro ganujin naa to she agau laagun kata zhiko kurkukuo be ma hakika uga afe dan mini eza gbigbacizhio
 He said O my Lord! the prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me Unless Thou turn away their snare from me I should in my youthful folly feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant,Ugan Tsoci! Katazhiko wuncin bami gan yanna elaa wami gan min jin bea yin na miga kansan ya da ebaa mima gaafe dan mini jahilizhio
 So his Lord hearkened to him in his prayer and turned away from him their snare Verily He heareth and knoweth all things,Tsociu cia aduwau gwo ucia ta nadi dedeazhi pan keu lugwa Hakika Soko Etsu uyio nae wo yandondo na Etsu nade kpikpe yandondo na
Then it occurred to the men after they had seen the signs that it was best to imprison him for a time,Gancin baci na a aya nazhie wu gwa zankpe Soko na leyeani na ubea tula yaa kede agau wan kandan da lokaci ndoci na
Now with him there came into the prison two young men Said one of them I see myself in a dream pressing wine said the other I see myself in a dream carrying bread on my head and birds are eating thereof Tell us they said The truth and meaning thereof for we see thou art one that doth good to all,Gbarufu guba ndocizhi cia gandan katazhiko be uyin Nini miniabo cigan Hakika mi nana ke mie kan nuwan egye na zabaci ci gan Hakika mi nana kede mia evo masa la ta etimibo na harma elugizhi fe gi dagan miniubo ya yi labari yan fasara ena nanazhi hakika yie le wyo ye dan mini za guruzhio
He said Before any food comes in due course to feed either of you I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you that is part of the duty which my Lord hath taught me I have I assure you abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in Allah and that even deny the Hereafter,Ugan Ade yangici ndondo naala be yaye gbani naa sai de miga ye ya labari fasara ena nanazhi bedzo kafia la yangicia be a ya ye na Wuncinma dan mini yanna Tsoci mi la kpikpeu wumi nao Hakika mia dzuntinya daga ekpa zanazhie jin imani be Soko yinana amaajin kafirinci be Efo zobae na
And I follow the ways of my fathers- Abraham Isaac and Jacob and never could we attribute any partners whatever to Allah that comes of the grace of Allah to us and to mankind yet most men are not grateful,Mi ma emi tu ekpa yan yanmanci mizhi Ibrahima to Ishaka to Yakubu U gwo yi yin naa gan gan yie la yandoci a pa Soko baci naa wuncin madan mini eryatwa Soko na ta eti yibo na to zawangizhio tso amade ekun dondo zawangizhi e jin yeboa
O my two companions of the prison! I ask you are many lords differing among themselves better or the One Allah Supreme and Irresistible,Ya ye eyami yan katazhiko zhi! Ngba Tsoci kanma na ezaafe wun na ugade alheri gano kashi Soko Nini kete nayi Etsu zankpe na
If not Him ye worship nothing but names which ye have named- ye and your fathers- for which Allah hath sent down no authority the command is for none but Allah He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him that is the right religion but most men understand not,Yannazhi ye wun zunma Soko na ufea saide sunnazhi nazhi yetso to yanmanci yezhi tu sunnao na Soko cin hujja ndondo be etiaboa Hakika hukunci jin yan Soko gbaugi uyio u majin foro gan ye gajin bauta ya yandondo ma saide Soko Wuncin gayi adini yan gboro amaade ekundondo zawangizhi ade kpikpea
O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink as for the other he will hang from the cross and the birds will eat from off his head so hath been decreed that matter whereof ye twain do enquire,Ya ye masoyi mizhi! Yan kata zhiko amaade zaeni mini yebo wyunafe ya ndakatau egye fin ammaa zabaci tso a gau fo sa gancin elugizhi cia fe be gi dagan mini etiubo Ama hukunci baa ni eti yannazhi ye gbingan tiubo na
 And of the two to that one whom he consider about to be saved he said Mention me to thy lord But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord and Joseph lingered in prison a few more years,Ucia gan be natso u kpewo gan ugaa gan gwa minia bona gan Wyo gajinopa ndakata wyoe tukpa eti alamari mi bo shetan cia tanba ce tau uci pa ndakatau tukpaa u ci fedun gun katazhiko yan eya ndocizhi
 The king of Egypt said I do see in a vision seven fat kine whom seven lean ones devour and seven green ears of corn and seven others withered O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions,Etsu cia gan be jamaazhi gan Hakika mi na-na be nanko gutwaba ndocizhi nazhi de nakana na acie la nazhi wancin na wangi na be gwala yangici sunsun gutwaba nayi nuwan fini-fini na be gutwaba ndocizhi nazhi yi wiwocizhi na Ya ye manko zhi wancinzhi!

They said A confused medley of dreams and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams,Agan E na nazhi bokeba umayi vunvunci na uga wyo na kawanyino yi ma de kpikpe yan fasara enazhi iri yan wyo nanaa
But the man who had been released one of the two who had been in prison and who now bethought him after so long a space of time said I will tell you the truth of its interpretation send ye me therefore,Zanzatso gangwa mini za guba nazhi fi katazhiko be Yusufui na cia gan ba ci na lokaci sa -- gan na gan Mia ya ye fasara ena wuncin ebo acino etun mi tun
 O Joseph! he said O man of truth! Expound to us the dream of seven fat kine whom seven lean ones devour and of seven green ears of corn and seven others withered that I may return to the people and that they may understand,Uci da katazhiko eba Annabi Yusufu uci gan Ya wyoe Yusufu na yi eza gaskiya na ya yi fasara ena eti nanko gutwaba nazhi wancin nakano na gancin acide nanko gutwaba nazhi wancina na acie la nazhi wancin na gina be gwala gutwaba yan yangici sunsun nazhi yi nuwan fini-fini na be ndoci nazhi yi wiwocizhi na gan ya mi ebo minda eba za nazhi tun mi be na ebo atsoa de kpikpe
Joseph said For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont and the harvests that ye reap ye shall leave them in the ear- except a little of which ye shall eatAnnabi Yusufu ci gan yea nunu yan eya gutwaba naa batua na yangici nazhi yega ku latio na yea ya fi egwa finiazhio sai degi na ye gagi na,
 Then will come after that period seven dreadful years which will devour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them- all except a little which ye shall have specially guarded,Gancin be baci wuncino eya gutwaba nazhi de ezozhi tsanani zhi na cia bea yan nazhi ye ku yekan kpata na ku gi saide degi mini nazhi ye ku swo ci tswa na
 Then will come after that period a year in which the people will have abundant water and in which they will press wine and oil,Gancin zunma wuncino eyndocia be be na miniubo yeade ele na miniubo ma yeade eyanfinci zhi kanfin
So the king said Bring ye him unto me But when the messenger came to him Joseph said Go thou back to thy lord and ask him ´What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands´ For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare,Etsu ciganE lau be ya mi kamina tuci naatun na lo ebau na ugan etsu e yi wyoe uci gan wyotso kezhe da eba ndakata wyoewyo mao gbinugan gan ki yi hali na ynzagi nazhi bagwaazhi na dany-ninbo gbani nao Hakika Soko yibe kpikpe makirinci nazhie jin na
The king said to the ladies What was your affair when ye did seek to seduce Joseph from his true self The ladies said Allah preserve us! no evil know we against him! Said the ´Aziz´s wife Now is the truth manifest to all it was I who sought to seduce him from his true self He is indeed of those who are ever true and virtuous,Etsu gan Ngba ki ye kpa kamina ye fe wa Yusufu nao Aci gan Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko! Yikpe Yusufu ye be eyan dede ndondo yina Yin mi yan Aziz yan misra ci gan Gbani de gaskiyaatulani mitso be tin yin ga wa wyuno Hakika ma wyiny Yusufu udan mini eza gaskiyahio
 This say I in order that He may know that I have never been false to him in his absence and that Allah will never guide the snare of the false ones,Wuncin ma  na mi gan na ebou debau kpeu wo ke mi jinu hainci zunmau boa na Ebo na ma hakika Soko wyune la tanadi zanazhi gae jin hainci na ke ekoa
Nor do I absolve my own self of blame the human soul is certainly prone to evil unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy but surely my Lord is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Mima li ti tacin mi like aibi lugwaa hakika yangban wuna jin ufe jin za foro be etun dede saide zana Tsoci mi ga gunyeu na Hakika Tsoci mi Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegunuyio
So the king said Bring him unto me I will take him specially to serve about my own person Therefore when he had spoken to him he said Be assured this day thou art before our own presence with rank firmly established and fidelity fully proved!,Etsu ci gan E lau be yami minla wyun tsoba mi tso Kamina ugan gan be u yin na ugan Hakika de wyo de yin nanna wyo yi be kinigiba na wancin na eza aminci wyo ma yi eba yi bo
Joseph said Set me over the store-houses of the land I will indeed guard them as one that knows their importance,Yusufu ci gan A mi laata eti edzunba yan arziki kinbo hakika mi eza nae tswa yan na mi yio zana mayibe kpikpe etun wuncin na mi yio
Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land to take possession therein as when or where he pleased We bestow of our Mercy on whom We please and We suffer not to be lost the reward of those who do good,Acinga ga yi la kinigiba yan kagbo ya Yusufu ta eti kinbo ucie ce ka danbo lo bandondo na ga bau na Yi mae tsa zana ga ba yina be yegun yi yin Yi mae ta etun zanazhi gae jin bolobolo na yakpe a
But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best for those who believe and are constant in righteousness,Hakika ma egagba yan Alkiyami ude alheri gan ya zanazhi ga imani jin na acia fe za nazhie tswa Soko a mae sundanu na
 Then came Joseph´s brethren they entered his presence and he knew them but they knew him not,Yegi Yusufu zhi ci dabe acia gandan ebaubo ucia dza tin ammade a lau be woa
And when he had furnished them forth with provisions suitable for them he said Bring unto me a brother ye have of the same father as yourselves but a different mother see ye not that I pay out full measure and that I do provide the best hospitality,Kamina ujin shiri kaya yangicizhi yaa zo na ugan yega jinebe ya mi be yegi ye natso yi yan ndani be ye yin nae Ngba yetso leye kendoe mie she tsunwan naa mimaajin mife jin bolo bolo ya egazhi sarauyina
Now if ye bring him not to me ye shall have no measure of corn from me nor shall ye even come near me,To kagan ma ye be yami beu yina yea kara de tsunwan ndondo eba mibo bea ye mae ga dzodzo tsoba mi ma
They said We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father Indeed we shall do it,Acigan To yidea da din yangban babau cinle hakika ma yiga acinga jin
 And Joseph told his servants to put their stock-in-trade with which they had bartered into their saddle-bags so they should know it only when they returned to their people in order that they might come back,Yusufu cia gan be egi katauzhi gan yea kaya naala sangwa yangici shi na laadan jikaazhio ebo atsoa leu ye aga zheban da eba iyaliazhi na ebo ma a kezhea zhe bana zhin
Now when they returned to their father they said O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get unless we take our brother So send our brother with us that we may get our measure and we will indeed take every care of him,Lokaci na azhin eba babaa na a gan Ya wyoe babayi! Dagan gbani lo ye gboro a tsunwan yangici laakan yi agan sai de wyo ga yegi yi laadan ezan yibo kanga ga a la tsunwan yangici ya yi yio Hakikama yigafe zanazhia fe tswau na
 He said Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime But Allah is the best to take care of him and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!,Ugan Ngba micin la aminci yaye etiubo Saide u yi iri aminci nami la yaye payin eti yegiu bo na Soko tsayi Etsu na gan eba eyan tswao nao wyun ga mayi Etsu nagan eba yeguno nao
Then when they opened their baggage they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them They said O our father! What more can we desire this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us so we shall get more food for our family We shall take care of our brother and add at the same time a full camel´s load of grain to our provisions This is but a small quantity,Kamina abe kpe jikaazhi na a tsun yannazhi a la sangwa yangici shi na fi mini jikaazhio a yana la zheban yaa agan Ya wyoe babayi! Yi zun ganmanaani ngan kayayi na yia sangwa yangici shi na a yan yi laazheban zhin yayi yi gabe ye lo be yia wa yangici be ya iyali yizhi yimaa kangwa ya yegi yi yi maga tsunwan yan kaya rakumi nini be ta tiubo Tsunwan wuncin ma yanna de sauki na uyio
Jacob said Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me in Allah´s name that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in and made powerless And when they had sworn their solemn oath he said Over all that we say be Allah the witness and guardian!,Babaa ci gan Mia tunu lo ganni be ye yina sai ye ga jin mi alkawali tsakani ye be Sokoe kede hakika ye gau lazhin bea ya mi na saide ugaa ce kagbo ye kamina abea alkawali jin beuyin na ugan Soko ma wyun gayi Erio wakili eti egan nazhi yie gan nao
 Further he said O my sons! enter not all by one gate enter ye by different gates Not that I can profit you aught against Allah with my advice None can command except Allah On Him do I put my trust and let all that trust put their trust on Him,Uci kezhea gan be Ya ye egi mizhi! Ega gandan misrao kpatae dagan eko ninio ma egan-dan dagan ekouzhio kakayin Mima kunke ya ye wo be yandoci dagan eba Soko boa hakika hukunci jin de yan Soko uyio wyun ga ma mi yakpeo zanazhi magae wa zanaaya kpena adaa yaa kpe Soko
And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined it did not profit them in the least against the plan of Allah It was but a necessity of Jacob´s soul which he discharged For he was by our instruction full of knowledge and experience but most men know not,To lokaci naa gandan dagan eko na babaa gan yaa na wuncinotso kunke yaa wo be yandoci ke yanna Soko kpa na lugwa saide bukata ndoci uyio dan yangban Yaakubuo nama wyunudewo na hakikama ezauyio na yi be kpikpe yan yannazhi Yi la wuu na amaade ekundondo zawangizhi kpea
Now when they came into Joseph´s presence he received his full brother to stay with him He said to him Behold! I am thy own brother so grieve not at aught of their doings,Kamina agandan eba Yusufuo na wyuna yegiu dinba uci gan Hakika mi yegi wyoe mi yio ebo acino ga nyin yangban be iri etun nazhie lo na ma
At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions suitable for them he put the drinking cup into his brother´s saddle-bag Then shouted out a crier O ye in the caravan! behold! ye are thieves without doubt!,Kamina wyuna shiri yan karaazhi jin yaa zo na wyuna evo tsunwan yan nuwanfin laagun jika yegiubo gancin emi yaci ndoci ci yami gan ya ye jamaa ezan daci nnazhi! Hakika de igbecizhi ye yio
 They said turning towards them What is it that ye miss,A cia gan lokaci na azhe ye lo ebaa na ki ya yan ye yio
They said We miss the great beaker of the king for him who produces it is the reward of a camel load I will be bound by it,Agan Yie wa evo tsunwan nuwan fin yan etsu za wuna ya zaeni ndondo na ma gau la be na wyunade eryatwa yan kara rakum nini mitso gamaa gikini ya wuncino
The brothers said By Allah! well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land and we are no thieves!,A ci gan Wallahi hakika yetso kpewo kede yibe-be ebo yibey nyin yanydan kinboa na yi majin igbecizhia
 The Egyptians said What then shall be the penalty of this if ye are proved to have lied,Zaba etsu zhi cigan kii yi foro naaga gun be za na aga deu beyin nao wunayi ganmana ye zuno nao
They said The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found should be held as bondman to atone for the crime Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers!,Agan Foro wuncin wuna ta eti zana aga deu jikaubo nao forou ala egwaasunu acinga ga egagba yan azwalumizhi yio
So he began the search with their baggage before he came to the baggage of his brother at length he brought it out of his brother´s baggage Thus did We plan for Joseph He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it so We raise to degrees of wisdom whom We please but over all endued with knowledge is one the All-Knowing,Ucia ca be cin cinle jikaazhi kafi yan yegiuna gancin ucia evo tsunwan wuncin wa tinya dagan jika yegiubo Acinga ga yi jin shiri ya Yusufuo Wuna -- yin ya wuna na wyuna -- yegiu eti hukunci etsu Misrao naasaide acin ga ba Soko na Yie la darajazhi tu ya zana ga ba yina Ta eti yan kpikpeci ndondo ade kpikpeci na ganuna
They said If he steals there was a brother of his who did steal before him But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart revealing not the secrets to them He simply said to himself Ye are the worse situated and Allah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!,Acigan Wyun de ga yi yan yi ga to hakika yegi wyuntso yiyan le ani Yusufu cia egan nana swo dan yangbanubo uma lau tinya wua ucie gan dan yangbanubo yetso tsa yi za dedezhi na gan nao Soko ma de kpikpe gan be iri etu nazhi ye lona
They said O exalted one! Behold! he has a father aged and venerable who will grieve for him so take one of us in his place for we see that thou art gracious in doing good,Agan Ya wyoe Aziz! Hakika uyibe babae na maaku ku na ebo acino a zaeni la mini yibo kinigibaubo Hakika yi mae le wyo ye dan mini eza bolobolozhio
He said Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property indeed if we did so we should be acting wrongfully,Ugan Sokou gwo yiu tswa na yi ga gwasun zandoci na ma yi le kaya yi ye beu yina nae yiga jin acin ngan yigaafe dan mini azwalumizhio danona
 Now when they saw no hope of his yielding they held a conference in private The leader among them said Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah´s name and how before this ye did fail in your duty with Joseph Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me or Allah commands me and He is the best to command,Kamina abea kauna ba beuyin eti aye wa nao naaci da kapa-nni fe da baza Nunsaa ci gan Beke ye kpewo gan baba ye-yea alkawali la be ye yin yan tsakani ye be Soko yinana Yetso ma kpe iri eye na ye ya be be YusufuI na to mide a ya kin yan Misraa har she babami ga mi ya izini yan zhinzhin koma Sokou jin hukunci naga bauna be mi yin Wyun ga mayi Etsu hukunci jin cizhio
Turn ye back to your father and say ´O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! we bear witness only to what we know and we could not well guard against the unseen!,She ye zhebane da eba baba ye yecie ganugan Ya wyoe babayi! Hakika egi wyoe wyuna yan yi! Yima ya eri nana yaa saide yan yanna yide kpikpeu na yi made kpikpe yannazhia swo naa
´Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned and you will find we are indeed telling the truth´,Wyo mao gbin za alkarya na yi dan nin yanubo na gan u gayi Misrao to kodagba nazhi yi zhi ganni be yin na Hakika ma gaskiya yie tao
 Jacob said Nay but ye have yourselves contrived a story good enough for you So patience is most fitting for me Maybe Allah will bring them back all to me in the end For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom,Ugan ujin acina yangban ye zhi dea yandoci laa panin fi ye eyan dede hakuri de uga gye ya mi gano mi mae ba be Sokoe gan wyunu kua zhiu beu yami baenio Hakika Soko gayi Etsu kpikpeo ugayi Etsu hikimao
And he turned away from them and said How great is my grief for Joseph! And his eyes became white with sorrow and he fell into silent melancholy,Ucia zunma uce ebaabo uci gan kasa mire eti Yusufuo! Eyeuzhi cia zhe bokun ebo yangban yino gancin umaa she be fushii
And he turned away from them and said How great is my grief for Joseph! And his eyes became white with sorrow and he fell into silent melancholy,Ucia zunma uce ebaabo uci gan kasa mire eti Yusufuo! Eyeuzhi cia zhe bokun ebo yangban yino gancin umaa she be fushii
 They said By Allah! never wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness or until thou die!,Agan Wallahi wyo dea ya yekpa eti Yusufu boa har sai wyo gaa tanyan yan iyaka etiubo ko ma wyo-olao feo dan mini eza tsutsuci zhio
He said I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah and I know from Allah that which ye know not,Ugan Hakika mi de ela lali mi be yangbannyin mi la wu Soko mi ma de kpikpe dagan eba Soko yan yanazhi yede kpikpea na
O my sons! go ye and enquire about Joseph and his brother and never give up hope of Allah´s Soothing Mercy truly no one despairs of Allah´s Soothing Mercy except those who have no faith,Ya ye egi mizhi! Elo-ye dae wa labari Yusufue be be yan yegiu yin ye mae ga ba kauna be yegun Sokoe ma Hakika ma ade za nae ba kauna be yegun Sokoe naa saide jamaa nazhi yi kafirizhi na
Then when they came back into Joseph´s presence they said O exalted one! distress has seized us and our family we have now brought but scanty capital so pay us full measure we pray thee and treat it as charity to us for Allah doth reward the charitable,Lokaci na a gandan eba Yusufuo na agan Ya wyoe Azizu egun yan madan wuna de yi be iyali yizhi yima be-be be yanna yigaa sangwa yangici shi na nama gan daraja deana ebo acino a tsunwan she yayi wyo mao jin sadakao yayi hakika Sokoe la egagba alheri ya zana gae jin sadakana
He said Know ye how ye dealt with Joseph and his brother not knowing what ye were doing,Ugan Ngba yema kpe yan na ye jin be Yusufui to wyiny to yegiu yin na kamina ye yeafe dan mini jahilizhio na
 They said Art thou indeed Joseph He said I am Joseph and this is my brother Allah has indeed been gracious to us all behold he that is righteous and patient- never will Allah suffer the reward to be lost of those who do right,Agan Kashi eti hakikao wyo ga yi Yusufuo Ugan Mi ga yi Yusufuo zanana ma yegi mi uyio hakika Soko jin falala yayi hakika de zaeni ndondo naga sundan Soko na uma ci jin hakuri na to hakika Sokoe ta laada etun za guruzhi ya kpea
They said By Allah! indeed has Allah preferred thee above us and we certainly have been guilty of sin!,Agan Wallahi hakika Sokoa wyo la ta eti yibo hakika ma yi yia fe dan mini bici cin cizhio
He said This day let no reproach be cast on you Allah will forgive you and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!,Ugan Yin na-nnade lefi ndondo ke ta eti yeboa Sokoafa be ye yinWyunga mayi Etsu yeguno
Go with this my shirt and cast it over the face of my father he will come to see clearly Then come ye here to me together with all your family,Yea ewomi nana laa daa yecie la wune ce zhi yegboro baba mi bo ugaafe za nae le ba ye na Ye mae be be iyali yezhi kpata baenio
 When the caravan left Egypt their father said I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph Nay think me not a dotard,Kamina jamaa wunchinzhi ya Misra cie zhin na babaa ci gan Hakika de mie wo ekan Yusufu kagan de yea gan gan zhizhi eku-kue kunmi mia na
They said By Allah! truly thou art in thine old wandering mind,Agan Wallahi hakika de to gbani wyo yi dan mini zhizhi wyobo naajin fo na
 Then when the bearer of the good news came He cast the shirt over his face and he forthwith regained clear sight He said Did I not say to you ´I know from Allah that which ye know not´,To lokaci na za naa ya bushara yangban fa na be na wyuna ewo ce keu fuskao ucia fe zanae leba ye na Ugan A sa mi gan yaye gan mi de kpikpe dagan eba Soko yan yannazhi yede kpikpea naa yina
They said O our father! ask for us forgiveness for our sins for we were truly at fault,Agan Ya wyoe babayi! Wa gafara yayi yan lefi yizhi hakika yi yia fe dan mini bici cin cizhio
 He said Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you for he is indeed Oft-Forgiving Most MercifulUgan Bele yin mia ba gafara ya ye be Tsoci mi yin Hakika wyun gayi Etsu gafarao wyun ga mayi Etsu yeguno,
 Then when they entered the presence of Joseph he provided a home for his parents with himself and said Enter ye Egypt all in safety if it please AllahKamina agandan eba Yusufuo na wyuna yanmanciuzhi gbadza uci gan E gandan Misrao uga ba Soko ma ye a gangan dan eza amincizhi,
And he raised his parents high on the throne of dignity and they fell down in prostration all before him He said O my father! this is the fulfilment of my vision of old! Allah hath made it come true! He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you all here out of the desert even after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers Verily my Lord understandeth best the mysteries of all that He planneth to do for verily He is full of knowledge and wisdom,Ucia yanmanciuzhi laata eti gado mulkio acia vokpaazhi zhi kinbo fe saumi uci gan Ya wyoe babami nana ga yi fasara ena na mi na shidzo nao Hakika Tsoci mi wyunu laa fe gaskiya hakikama uijn bolobolo be mi yin kamina uwa mi tin ya katazhiko na uma ye kube dagan latio baci na shetan gandan tsakani mibo be ye gimizhi na Hakika Tsocimi Etsu Tosayi uyio be zana ga baunae Hakika wyin Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
O my Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on me some power and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams and events- O Thou Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter Take Thou my soul at death as one submitting to Thy will as a Muslim and unite me with the righteous,Ya wyoe Tsoci mi! hakika wyo yami mulki wyoma wu mi kpikpe ndoci mini fasara enazhio Ya wyo najin sanmazhi to kin na wyo gayi Ndakata mi to izhe to ekubo Wyo gaa wu mi O wu mi Musulumi wyo mao la mio keba be za guruzhi
Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen which We reveal by inspiration unto thee nor wast thou present with them then when they concerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots,Wuncinzhi dan mini labari gaibuzhio na Yie jin wahayiu ya wyo na Wyo ma dan tacinabo kamina a ku alamariazhi yekan aci gunmi aci fe jin tanadizhi naa
Yet no faith will the greater part of mankind have however ardently thou dost desire it,Ekun dondo zawangizhi ma ajin imania ka daa ma wyo gae bavun acin
Ekun dondo zawangizhi ma ajin imania ka daa ma wyo gae bavun acin,
 And no reward dost thou ask of them for this it is no less than a message for all creatures,Wyo ma gbinagan yandondo yan egagba eti etun na wyoe lo na boa Uma jin yandoci ALKURANU yia sai de sinsantu ya alittazhi kpata
And how many Signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by Yet they turn their faces away from them!,Amade aya dokun nazhie wugwa zankpe Soko na nazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na zawangizhi ajin afe daa -- gan aciga pan keu lugwa
And most of them believe not in Allah without associating other as partners with Him!,Ekundondoa ma e jin imani be Sokoe baeni boa sai de aga eyan laapau baci
Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the wrath of Allah- or of the coming against them of the final Hour all of a sudden while they perceive not,Kashi gbani a aminci yaya gan azaba Soko nae rukpe na ubeu beu yaa eti girikuo amaa laa fea dan kamina akpea na
 Say thou This is my way I do invite unto Allah- on evidence clear as the seeing with one´s eyes- I and whoever follows me Glory to Allah! and never will I join gods with Allah!,Gangan Nana gayi ekpa mi yino mie yi zazhi yi lo eba Soko eti hujjao be hankali to mi to zana gaa gba mi na
 Nor did We send before thee as messengers any but men whom we did inspire- men living in human habitations Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them But the home of the hereafter is best for those who do right Will ye not then understand,Yi ma tun Tucizhi tun shidzoa sai de bagizhi dagan mini eza alkaryazhio Yi ciejin wahayi be yaa Kii la acie za dan kinboa yino da ayea leye kendoe zoba zanazhi shidzo na yi yi naa Hakika ma emi yan eku ude alheri gan ya za nazhi gae sundan Soko cie tswa u na Kashi ye de hankali dea
 Respite will be granted until when the messengers give up hope of their people and come to think that they were treated as liars there reaches them Our help and those whom We will are delivered into safety But never will be warded off our punishment from those who are in sin,Harda kamina Tucizhi ga kauna ba be imani jin yan jamaa yanazhi na acia hakika ya ke de a ayi ganmana zunci zhi na kanga ga taimako Yi e be yaao Gancin Yicie la gwagan ya zana ga ba yi na zandondo mada azaba Yi gwa wo ta eti lefi jincizhi boa
There is in their stories instruction for men endued with understanding It is not a tale invented but a confirmation of what went before it- a detailed exposition of all things and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe,Hakika waazi sinsantu dan mini etanazhio ya zanazhi gade hankali na Alkuranu ma jin egan naa ye tswa naa amaade eganuyio nae la gaskiya ya dan Litafi nazhi shiudzo na uma yi bayani yan yandondo umayi bawu be yeguny ya jamaa nazhi gaejin imani na
 A L R A Book which We have revealed unto thee in order that thou mightest lead mankind out of the depths of darkness into light - by the leave of their Lord - to the Way of Him the Exalted in power worthy of all praise!-,ALIF LAM RA Alkuranu Litafi uyio yi ma cinu cin be ya wyoe ebo wyo la zawangizhio tinoya dagan bazhikozhio lo haske be izini Tsocia yin lo eko yan Etsu nayi Etsu zankpe na Etsu na zandondoe jin yebo ya na
Of Allah to Whom do belong all things in the heavens and on earth! But alas for the Unbelievers for a terrible penalty their Unfaith will bring them!-,Wyun ga yi Soko Etsu na wun yannazhi fi sanmazhio to nazhi fi kinbo nao Azaba yan zun yesun wunajin tabbata ya kafirizhi dagan mini azaba na gbota acia finna
Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter who hinder men from the Path of Allah and seek therein something crooked they are astray by a long distance,Zanazhia cin-cin be boye laa ya edunfe izhe cia gan yan eku na amaajin afe te eko Soko na aciajin afe wa kinkanu na za wuncinzhi fi mini egbin naa kpe ya na
We sent not a messenger except to teach in the language of his own people in order to make things clear to them Now Allah leaves straying those whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases and He is Exalted in power full of Wisdom,Yima laa tun Tuci tun lea sai de be zhimi jamaa yanuzhi eboujin bayani yandondo-u ya gancin Soko cie gbin zana ga bau na umaajinUla za na ga bauna ke eko Wyun ga ma yi Etsu zankpeo Etsu hikimao
rkness into light and teach them to remember the Days of Allah Verily in this there are Signs for such as are firmly patient and constant- grateful and appreciative,Hikika ma yi tun Musa tun be aya Yizhi kede Da jamaa yan wyozhi kutinya dagan bazhikozhio lo haske Wyomao paa tukpa eti efo soko zhi na -- gan ta eti alumma pa yinzhio na Hakika mini wuncino ayazhi danbo ya za ndondo nagae dokun be hakuri jiny-na umae dokun be yebojiny-na
 Remember! Moses said to his people Call to mind the favour of Allah to you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh they set you hard tasks and punishments slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord,Wyo mao pa kamina Musa fe gan ya jamaa yanuzhi gan E pa niima Soko na ta eti yebo na kamina ugan ye gwa dagan egun jamaa firaunazhio na E yaye azaba dede fin aciajin afe zun egi bagi yezhi acie la yinzagizhi ya be rayia yin Hakika mini wuncino mimacinle wanciko danbo dagan eba Tsoci yebo
And remember! your Lord caused to be declared publicly If ye are grateful I will add more favours unto you But if ye show ingratitude truly My punishment is terrible indeed,Ye mae kezhe-epa lokaci na Tsoci ye ya mi na U gan Hakika ye gae jin yebo hakikama mia fe be bibe yema gaa cin mana bo hakika azaba mi yanna de tsanani na uyio
 And Moses said If ye show ingratitude ye and all on earth together yet is Allah free of all wants worthy of all praise,Musa ci gan ye gaa jin kafirinci to ye to zanazhi fi kinbo baenio na hakika Soko Etsu bagwo uyio na ma zandondoe jin yebo ya na
Has not the story reached you O people! of those who went before you - of the people of Noah and ´Ad and Thamud - And of those who came after them None knows them but Allah To them came messengers with Clear Signs but they put their hands up to their mouths and said We do deny the mission on which ye have been sent and we are really in suspicious disquieting doubt as to that to which ye invite us,Kashi labari zanazhi zhiyedzo na be ya ye yea ke yan jamaa yan Nuhu to Adu to Samudi na to zanazhi be dan zunmaabo na Zandondo kpea kpea yea sai egwaazhi laafi misunazhio a sun-sun aci gan Hakika yi yia jin kafirinci be yanna a tun ye tun be yin nae hakika ma yi yie jin shakka be yannazhi ye yi yi gan yi bey tsun na yangban yi mae ceka
Their messengers said Is there a doubt about Allah The Creator of the heavens and the earth It is He Who invites you in order that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed! They said Ah! ye are no more than human like ourselves! Ye wish to turn us away from the gods our fathers used to worship then bring us some clear authority,Tuciazhi ci gan Ngba kelo kezhin ndoci danbo eti Soko Etsu na tswa sanmazhi to kin na Wyune yi ye yi ebo u fa be zunubi yezhi umau patau yaye har da lokaci nayi bibacina Agan Hakika yede fea sai de zawangi dozhin yizhi ye mae wawa gan ye la yi yie kane ke yanna yanmanci yizhi fe wun na lugwa To ebe ya yi be hujjazhi naa tulana
Their messengers said Is there a doubt about Allah The Creator of the heavens and the earth It is He Who invites you in order that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed! They said Ah! ye are no more than human like ourselves!

Their messengers said to them True we are human like yourselves but Allah doth grant His grace to such of his servants as He pleases It is not for us to bring you an authority except as Allah permits And on Allah let all men of faith put their trust,Tuciazhi cigan Yi yi yandondoa sai de zawangi naynci yezhi amaade Soko wyunajin ula eryatwau ya zana ga bau mini wuzhiu zhio na Uma -- yin yayi na yiala hujja ndoci be yaye naa sai de be izini Sokoe Muminizhi ma alaa yakpe Soko gbaugi
No reason have we why we should not put our trust on Allah Indeed He Has guided us to the Ways we follow We shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us For those who put their trust should put their trust on Allah,KiI maa kan yi cia ya kpe Sokoa yino uma yi wuba ta eti eko wangi yan yi bo Hakika ma yiga hakuri jin eti egun nazhi ye jin yi na Zanazhi magae wa zanaa yakpe na alaa yakpe Soko kawan yin
 And verily We shall cause you to abide in the land and succeed them This for such as fear the Time when they shall stand before My tribunal- such as fear the punishment denounced,Yima ga ye laa fedun dan kin miabo zunmaabo Wuncin ma gaajin tabbata jin ya zana gae sundan gbarogi yegboro mibo na umae sundan azaba Mi na
 But they sought victory and decision there and then and frustration was the lot of every powerful obstinate transgressor,Aci ba aduwa yan eko kpe be nasarae Zaeni ndondo na yi etikagboci ragbanzhi ci na cia gba a jin hallaka

 The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous day No power have they over aught that they have earned that is the straying far far from the goal,Kotonci yan zanazhi jin kafirinci be Tsocia yin nae etunazhi ke tutunpare na uyio na efe ku dan mini efo dundufe ko na acide kagbo ndondo eti etun kiriki naa lo na boa Wuncin ganyi egbin naa kpe ya nao

Again and again will those who disbelieve wish that they had bowed to Allah´s will in Islam,Lokacina dokun na kafirizhia jin afe jin guri gan eganegan gan musulumizhi ayia
Leave them alone to enjoy the good things of this life and to please themselves let false hope amuse them soon will knowledge undeceive them,Ayaafeagi yanaza amaa fea wo-man gurizhi mau fe ujina shagalau zabe le yin abe de kpikpe
Never did We destroy a population that had not a term decreed and assigned beforehand,Alkarya ndoci ma danbo nayi jin hallaka naa sai de wyoa tsuna be litafi naa tula nae

Even so do we let it creep into the hearts of the sinners -,Acinga ga ma Yia jin Yi la alkuranua gandan yangban lefi jinci zhi bo

 Even if We opened out to them a gate from heaven and they were to continue all day ascending therein,Kadaa ma Yi ga eko kpe yaa dagan sanmao har afe acie gun lo bo

Inevitable cometh to pass the Command of Allah seek ye not then to hasten it Glory to Him and far is He above having the partners they ascribe unto Him!,Alamari Soko Alkiyami da beani ebo acino ega din bibeu ye ma Lili kpataajin tabbata ya Soko umaa latu ke yannazhie la pau baci na lugwa
He doth send down His angels with inspiration of His Command to such of His servants as He pleaseth saying Warn Man that there is no god but I so do your duty unto Me,Wyune cin malaikazhi be be wahayi ndoci dagan mini foro ubo ya zana ga bau mini wuzhiu zhio na kede Ejin gangba kede hakika ade Tsoci ndoci naa wun naa sai de Mi na Ebo acino ye afe zanazhie sundan Mi na
 He has created the heavens and the earth for just ends Far is He above having the partners they ascribe to Him!,Wyuna alitta sanmazhi to kinzhi jin be gaskiyae Sokoa latu ke yannazhie la pau baci na lugwa
 He has created man from a sperm-drop and behold this same man becomes an open disputer!,Wyuna alitta zawangi jin dagan maniy bo gancin ucia zhe emigboci ewun sunci gbangba be alamari yi yin
 And cattle He has created for you men from them ye derive warmth and numerous benefits and of their meat ye eat,Dabba yan niimazhi ma wyuna jin yaye ye mae de yanna ye laa kanfe na dagan miniubo to eyan anfani na dokun na ye mae kezhe de nakanuzhi gi
And ye have a sense of pride and beauty in them as ye drive them home in the evening and as ye lead them forth to pasture in the morning,Ye mae kezhe de eyan ninpazhi dagan miniubo Wyune laazhe esa yaye kamina ye gae kua zhin mi lozuny-na to kamina yegae kua tinya laazhin-y-na
 And they carry your heavy loads to lands that ye could not otherwise reach except with souls distressed for your Lord is indeed Most Kind Most Merciful,Amae la karayezhi yaye lo ezhi nazhi yea lo woa sai de be wanalae na Hakika Tsuci ye Etsu tosayi uyio Etsu yegun ma uyio
And He has created horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and use for show and He has created other things of which ye have no knowledge,To doko to alfadari to tyatyagi wyunajin yaye ebo ye fe tua amaa laafe ninpaaya ye be Umae jin alita yannazhi yede kpikpeaa na

It is He who sends down rain from the sky from it ye drink and out of it grows the vegetation on which ye feed your cattle,Kara yan bawu lo eko natso yi gboro na be Soko yin-udano dagan mini ekozhi nazhi yi kandan na danbo Wyunaba Soko ba da ugae wuba baenio
 With it He produces for you corn olives date-palms grapes and every kind of fruit verily in this is a sign for those who give thought,Be nuwan wuncin-y wyunela yandzozhi tinya to zaituna to dabinazhi to inabizhi be yangici sunsun iri ndondoe Hakika mini wuncinzhio egwa wuzhi dan bo yan zankpe Soko ya zanazhi gae kpaye na
He has made subject to you the Night and the Day the sun and the moon and the stars are in subjection by His Command verily in this are Signs for men who are wise,Umaa yeshi to batin jin foro yaye to igidi ti etswa to tswangizhi kpata wyunajin foro be kagbou yin Hakika mini wuncinzhio egwa wu yan zankpe Sokozhi danbo ya jamaa nazhi ga yibe hankali na
And the things on this earth which He has multiplied in varying colours and qualities verily in this is a sign for men who celebrate the praises of Allah in gratitude,To yannazhi ujin alittaazhi ya ye fi kinbo nazhi mayi be kala launi iri iri zhi-na Hakika mini wuncin zhio egwa wu yan zankpe Soko danbo ya jamaa nazhi gae kpa ye na
It is He Who has made the sea subject that ye may eat thereof flesh that is fresh and tender and that ye may extract therefrom ornaments to wear and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves that ye may seek thus of the bounty of Allah and that ye may be grateful,Wyun ga majin edu foro ebo ye de nakan managizhi nazhi yi didacizhi nae gi ye mae ku eyan nin pazhi tinya dagan miniubo na ye fan na wyo maa le eya nuwanzhi ye nazhie patu dan miniubo na ebo ma ye de bae wa falala bibe arziki dagan ebo Soko ebo ma be wunciny ye lae fe zanazhi ejin yebo ya Soko na
 And He has set up on the earth mountains standing firm lest it should shake with you and rivers and roads that ye may guide yourselves,Umaa patizhi ce fi kinbo ebo ube du ko dan yi be ye yin ma Umaa eduzhi to ekozhi jin yaye ebo be wunciny ye lae ke eko
And marks and sign-posts and by the stars men guide themselves,To alama sinsantu ndocizhi to be tswangizhi ajin afe de bawu
 Is then He Who creates like one that creates not Will ye not receive admonition,Ngba za nae jin alitta na ugaazhe ye-ni be zanaejin alitta na KiI la ye cie kpayea yino
If ye would count up the favours of Allah never would ye be able to number them for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Ye ma ga gangan yea ba niima nazhi Soko jin yaye na aa ye ba yaye yea Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
And Allah doth know what ye conceal and what ye reveal,Soko ma yi be kpikpe yannazhi ye swo na to nazhi ye tula naSurah And Allah doth know what ye conceal and what ye revealSoko ma yi be kpikpe yannazhi ye swo na to nazhi ye tula na
Those whom they invoke besides Allah create nothing and are themselves created,Zanazhi-ma ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa na ajin alitta yandondo woa ngan atso ajin alittaa zhi jin
They are things dead lifeless nor do they know when they will be raised up,Eyan tsutsucizhi ayio eyan be rayizhi yina amakpe lokaci na a sana naa
Your Allah is one Allah as to those who believe not in the Hereafter their hearts refuse to know and they are arrogant,Tsoci ye ma Tsoci nini uyio amaade zanazhi jin imani be Efo zoba yina na yangbaazhie navo amaafe zanazhie gbo ti ka na
 Undoubtedly Allah doth know what they conceal and what they reveal verily He loveth not the arrogant,Gaskiya uyio hakika Soko yibe kpikpe yan yannazhi ye swo kpatana to yannazhi e jin tula kpata na Hakika Sokoe wa eza tikagboci zhia
When it is said to them What is it that your Lord has revealed they say Tales of the ancients!,Ama ga gan beayin gankiI Tsociye cin be o Ajin agan gan Ecin zhi ayio yan za payin zhi
 Let them bear on the Day of Judgment their own burdens in full and also something of the burdens of those without knowledge whom they misled Alas how grievous the burdens they will bear!,Wuncin mayi ebo baa la kara zunubiazhi baenio Efo Alkiyami-y to lefi zanazhi a kufi egbino umayi be kpikpe yinana Acinga gao kara nazhi ala na wuna biye
 Those before them did also plot against Allah´s Way but Allah took their structures from their foundations and the roof fell down on them from above and the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive,Hakika zanazhi shiadzo na ajin shiri yan makirinci Soko cia emi nazhia tu na gbin ya dagan ekpouzhio yannazhi a la kpeu na cia kpan be kpea dagan titaabo azaba ci dabe yaa dagan bana a kpayetua na
 Then on the Day of Judgment He will cover them with shame and say Where are My ´partners´ concerning whom ye used to dispute with the godly Those endued with knowledge will say This Day indeed are the Unbelievers covered with shame and misery-,Gancin ma Efo Alkiyami Soko gaa sunzunye u cia gangan Ba zanazhi ye la pa mi baci ye cie gbomi etiabo na dano Zanazhi ye la pa mi baci ye cie gbomi etiabo na dano Zanazhi ala kpikpe yana ciganHakika zunyesun be yangbonyin dede ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi
Namely those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrong-doing to their own souls Then would they offer submission with the pretence We did no evil knowingly The angels will reply Nay but verily Allah knoweth all that ye didA g a y I  ,zanazhi kamina malaikazhi gea -- rayi bea yin na aafe zanazhia eti tacinajin zwalunci na atso ciga kpatsun ta acia gangan yi ma fe za nazhie lo tun dede ndoci naani Aa ujin acina hakika Soko yi be kpikpe etun nazhi ye lo na
So enter the gates of Hell to dwell therein Thus evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant,Wbo acino yea gandan eko yan jahannamazhio ye maa fibo fi tutunyin Lallai zoba zanazhie gbotika naa biye
To the righteous when it is said What is it that your Lord has revealed they say All that is good To those who do good there is good in this world and the Home of the Hereafter is even better and excellent indeed is the Home of the righteous-,Acia gan be zanazhi sundan Soko na gan kiI Tsoci ye cin beo Agan  Alheri Zanazhi ga lo tun wangi dan izhe na nao na ade egagba wangizhi egagba yan Alkiyami ma gan Madan-la be emi Aljanna yan zanazhie sundan Soko na
 Gardens of Eternity which they will enter beneath them flow pleasant rivers they will have therein all that they wish thus doth Allah reward the righteous-,Ugayi Emi Aljannazhi yan eman-wo aga gan fi bo nuwan managi eduzhi cia fe je fi tako abo ayibe eyan waci ndondoe fiminiabo Acinga ga Sokoe la egagba ya zanazhi gae sundanu acie tswau nao
 Namely those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity saying to them Peace be on you enter ye the Garden because of the good which ye did in the world, A g a y I  zanazhi kamina malaikazhi gae -- rayi beayin na afi mini yangban fao nao acia fe gan gan Aminci Soko u laujin tabbata u yaye eganda Aljannao ebo iri etun wangizhinazhi ye fe lo izheo nao
Do the ungodly wait until the angels come to them or there comes the Command of thy Lord for their doom So did those who went before them But Allah wronged them not nay they wronged their own souls,Ngan yandondo danbo na kafirizhi e tu ye naa sai de Malaikazhi nazhia la azaba be ya na koma foro yan Tsoci wyoe ndoci naabe yaa na acinga ga zanazhi be shiadzo na jino Soko ma jina zwaluncia atso tsa jin ti tacina zwaluncio
But the evil results of their deeds overtook them and that very Wrath at which they had scoffed hemmed them in,Egagba dede yan etun dede naalona cia de yannazhi ma afe lami na cia ma -- ba
The worshippers of false gods say If Allah had so willed we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His So did those who went before them But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message,Zanazhi la yan pa Soko baci na gan wuna ba Soko ba da yi yia jin bauta ya zandondo baci Soko boa to yi to yanmanciyizhi da yi maa la yandoci azhe haramu baci na Soko la jin haramu na boa Acinga ga zanazhi be shiadzo na jino Ngan yandondo ta eti Tuci boa saide eyan-wu yan gbangba
 For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger with the Command Serve Allah and eschew Evil of the People were some whom Allah guided and some on whom error became inevitably established So travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who denied the Truth,Hakika ma yi tun Tuci tun dan mini alumma ndondo kede Ejin bauta ya Soko ye mae kpe ya be shetan yin nae Miniabo ade nazhi Sokoa wuba na amade dan miniabo nazhi egbinajin tabbata ta etiabo na harda fo mi ajaliana Ebo acino edazan kpe eti kinbo ye mae cinele elo kendoe zoba yan ganmana zuncizhi yi yi na
 If thou art anxious for their guidance yet Allah guideth not such as He leaves to stray and there is none to help them,Ka da ma wyogae bavun eti ekokeabo to hakika Sokoe la zana ugaa gbin na ke ekoa amade zandondo danbo naajina taimako naa
 They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that Allah will not raise up those who die Nay but it is a promise binding on Him in truth but most among mankind realise it not,Ama zhi kuti be Sokoe lo iyaka yan gaskiya boa naakpena kede zana gaatsu na Sokoa naakin bea na Aa ujin acina ekin na Alkiyami alkawali uyio yan gaskiya na Soko jin na amaade ekun dondo zawangizhi kpea
They must be raised up in order that He may manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ and that the rejecters of Truth may realise that they had indeed surrendered to Falsehood,Soko ga alittazhi la nakin Ebo ujin bayaniuyaa yan yannazhi aga cedozhi leba etiubo na ebo ma to kafirizhia kpeawo kede hakika ayaafe ganmana zuncizhi na
For to anything which We have willed We but say the word Be and it is,Hakika yanna yia jin yi gan be yandoci kamina Yi ga kpa gan Yia jinu na yia jin yi gangan  Afe Uci gaafe ga
 To those who leave their homes in the cause of Allah after suffering oppression- We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater If they only realised this!,Zanazhi maga kpe la ebo Soko baci na aga jina zwalunci na hakika yi ga izhe le wangi jin shiri yaa egagba yan Alkiyami ma u wancin gan agaafe zanazhi de kpikpe de na
They are those who persevere in patience and put their trust on their Lord,Agayi zanazhia hakuri jin nao amaafe zanazhie yakpe Tsocia dan alamari ndondo nao
And before thee also the messengers We sent were but men to whom We granted inspiration if ye realise this not ask of those who possess the Message,Yima laatun zandoci tun shi wyo dzo lea sai de eza bagizhi nazhi ma Yi ajin yi jin wahayi ya na Ye mae gbin eza kpikpe nazhie pa Soko na gan wuna yi gan yede kpikpeana
We sent them with Clear Signs and Books of dark prophecies and We have sent down unto thee also the Message that thou mayest explain clearly to men what is sent for them and that they may give thought,Yi tuna tun fi ye be hujjazhi na bayaniazhi tula na to be Litafizhi Yi ma Alkuranu yan sinsantu cin bea ya wyoe ebo wyo jin bayanio ya zazhi yan yannazhi acinbe ya na ujin wo be wunciny agaafe zanazhie kpaye na
 Do then those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up or that the Wrath will not seize them from directions they little perceive-,Ngba zanazhie jin makirinci dedezhi na a sundan gan Soko tanafi wo be kin yina koma azabaubeu yaa dagan bana a kpaye tua naa yana
Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to and fro without a chance of their frustrating Him-,Koma u laau wan kpantsu kui mini dalo dazhina zhio ama gan Soko gwa woa
 Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - for thy Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy,Koma u laau wan eti hallaka jino karayin Hakika Tsoci ye Etsu tosayi uyio Etsu yegun uyio
 Do they not look at Allah´s creation even among inanimate things- How their very shadows turn round from the right and the left prostrating themselves to Allah and that in the humblest manner,Kashi acin le lo eba yannazhi Soko jin naa ndondo miniabo fifingi azhie yagwa lo gwaalo to gwaapinzhi amae jin sujada ya Soko amae dakpya zhizhi baeni boa
And to Allah doth obeisance all that is in the heavens and on earth whether moving living creatures or the angels for none are arrogant before their Lord,Yannazhi fi sanmao kpata na to nazhi fi kinbo mini dabbazhio na kpata Soko gae jin sujada yao amae lati dan fin boaSurah  They all revere their Lord high above them and they do all that they are commandedE sundan Tsoci dagan fitiabo amae jin yan na aga jina foro be jin jin-y-na
Allah has said Take not for worship two gods for He is just One Allah then fear Me and Me alone,Soko ma gan Ega la Tsoci guba Soko ma hakika Soko Tsoci Nini uyio Mi gbaugi gama yea sundano
 To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth and to Him is duty due always then will ye fear other than Allah,Yannazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na kpata Soko wuno jin jin adini ma wyun gbaugi ga wunbaeni bo Ngba yandoci najin Sokoa na ga ye sundano
And ye have no good thing but is from Allah and moreover when ye are touched by distress unto Him ye cry with groans,Yandondo nama ga dan beye yin yan eman-wo na dagan eba Soko bo afebeo gancin ma egun ndoci ga tswan ye ebau ga ye yea la egiti lo
 Yet when He removes the distress from you behold! some of you turn to other gods to join with their Lord-,Gancin ma ugaa egun laa keyabo yaye zandocczhi mini yebo ajin afe la yandocizhia pa Tsoci baci
As if to show their ingratitude for the favours we have bestowed on them! then enjoy your brief day but soon will ye know your folly!,Ebo adebaa cin manaabo be yannazhi yi la twarya yaa na Efe wo ma izhe degi bele-yin yea be de kpikpe
And they even assign to things they do not know a portion out of that which We have bestowed for their sustenance! By Allah ye shall certainly be called to account for your false inventions,Amaajin afe la robo ndoci ya yan na akpe egunu ko anfaniu yea na dagan mini arziki nazhi yi la yaa na ke eba-san boci jin kuti jin na Wallahi hakika a gbinegan eti yannazhi ye fe tswa yan ganmana na
And they assign daughters for Allah! - Glory be to Him! - and for themselves sons- the issue they desire!,Amaajin afe la egi ynzagizhi a ya Soko lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko ke wuncin lugwa atso cie la egi bagi nazhi ade shahawaana aya eti tacinatso zhi
When news is brought to one of them of the birth of a female child his face darkens and he is filled with inward grief!,Ama ga ya zaeni miniabo labari be mima egi yinzagi fuskau gaashi zhiko yangbanu magaa yin sarauyin
retain it on sufferance and contempt or bury it in the dust Ah! what an evil choice they decide on,Ucia jin ufe swo ye ya zawangizhi ebo labari dede naa ya wyun na ngba wyun la egiu gwo eti egbao kashi wyundau la wyunu swou gun kinbo Hakika hukunci wuncin nae ba na wuna biye
To those who believe not in the Hereafter applies the similitude of evil to Allah applies the highest similitude for He is the Exalted in Power full of Wisdom,Zanazhie jin imani Efo zoba yinana ayibe misali dede Soko gama wun siffa natso latu gan nao Wyun ga mayi Etsu zankpeo Etsu hikimao
To those who believe not in the Hereafter applies the similitude of evil to Allah applies the highest similitude for He is the Exalted in Power full of Wisdom,Zanazhie jin imani Efo zoba yinana ayibe misali dede Soko gama wun siffa natso latu gan nao Wyun ga mayi Etsu zankpeo Etsu hikimao
If Allah were to punish men for their wrong-doing He would not leave on the earth a single living creature but He gives them respite for a stated Term When their Term expires they would not be able to delay the punishment for a single hour just as they would not be able to anticipate it for a single hour,Da acigan Sokoe wan zawangizhi wan be zwalunciazhi lefiazhi da wyuna ya dabba ndondo zandondo nae dazan ta kinbo na ke kpe eti kinboa amaade wyune pata yaa da lokaci ndoci nayi kpikpeci ebaubo na Gancin ekaazhi gaakun a dinu zhin zunma ka yan lokaci ninia amaa taulo yegboroa
They attribute to Allah what they hate for themselves and their tongues assert the falsehood that all good things are for themselves without doubt for them is the Fire and they will be the first to be hastened on into it!,Amaajin afe la yan je Soko na atsoe navo na gintaraazhi cia fe zun ganmana kede hakika zoba wangi gaajin tabbata ya a na Egandin ndondo danboa hakika aga wun enao hakikama a cea ce fi bo ke yegun Soko lugwa
By Allah We also sent Our messengers to Peoples before thee but Satan made to the wicked their own acts seem alluring He is also their patron today but they shall have a most grievous penalty,Wallahi Yi tun Tucizhi fi alumma nazhi shi wyodzo na shetan cia etun dedezhi la pa nin fia wyun gayi ndakataa yin nao azaba na ma tan na gaajin tabbata yaa
 And We sent down the Book to thee for the express purpose that thou shouldst make clear to them those things in which they differ and that it should be a guide and a mercy to those who believe,Yi ma cin Litafi cin be ya wyo yaa saide ebo wyo yo jin bayanio yaa eti yannazhi e cedozhi leba dan miniubo na u mayi bawu be yeguny ya zanazhi ga imani jin na
 And Allah sends down rain from the skies and gives therewith life to the earth after its death verily in this is a Sign for those who listen,Soko gayi Etsu nae dule be dagan sanmao nao ucia kin dan rayi beuyin baci na wyuna tsu na Hakika mini wuncino egwa wu yan zankpe Soko danbo ya zanazhi gae wo gan na
And verily in cattle too will ye find an instructive sign From what is within their bodies between excretions and blood We produce for your drink milk pure and agreeable to those who drink it,Hakika ma ye de eyan yekpa dan mini dabbazhio ke nanko na yie yaye fin dagan mini yanna fi gbakoazhio na nae wa tinya tsakani ebio be egyae na uga yi nono lilici na man-ynfin ya zanazhi gae finu na
And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine ye get out wholesome drink and food behold in this also is a sign for those who are wise,Dagan mini sun-sun dobinazhio to inabizhio yeajin ye wa egye bo ye mae de arziki wangibo Hakika mini wuncino egwa wu yan zankpe Soko danbo ya zanazhi gayibe hankali na
 And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills on trees and in men´s habitations,Tsoci wyo cijin wahayi fi efuko kede A emizhi tu dan patizhio to cigbanzhio to mini ba nzhi agae tu na
 Then to eat of all the produce of the earth and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours wherein is healing for men verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought,Gancin ma wyo-ogi dagan yangici sunsun ndondo wyo mao ganodan eko yan Tsoci wyozhio nazhi ujin foro ya wyo na Eyan finci zhi nazhi yi iri iri zhina e tinya dagan gbakoabo miniubo be egunsa danbo ya zawangizhi Hakika mini wuncino egwa wu yan zankpe Soko danbo ya jamaa nazhi gae kpaye na
 It is Allah who creates you and takes your souls at death and of you there are some who are sent back to a feeble age so that they know nothing after having known much for Allah is All-Knowing All-Powerful,Soko gama jin alittaye zhio gancin ma wyun gawu ye yeo Miniyebo ade nazhi gaa kuku baenio har na wyuna kpe yandondo ye bea na baci nama ukpeaye le na Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu iko ma uyio

 Allah has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess so as to be equal in that respect Will they then deny the favours of Allah,Soko maa falala bagwo laaya sashi yezhi ta eti sashizhio dan mini arzikio zanazhi ma Soko jin bagwo ya na ajin yeda na aga arzikiazhi laaya wuzhiazhi harma ala zhe nini mini mulkijin be arziki wunciny naa Kashi niima Soko gae jin kafirinci be yino
And Allah has made for you mates and companions of your own nature and made for you out of them sons and daughters and grandchildren and provided for you sustenance of the best will they then believe in vain things and be ungrateful for Allah´s favours-Soko ga la yinzagi yaye mini nakan kpace yetso bo uci jin egizhi to yagizhi yaye dagan mini yinmi yezhio uma yaye arzikizhi dagan eyan wangi wangi zhio Ngba ganmana tsa aye ya gaskiyao acie jin kafirinci be niima Soko zhi yino,
Amae jin bauta ya yandoci najin Sokoa na na ma de mulki arziki ndondo yaa wo dagan sanmazhio ko kinboa na har amaa laa saajin ade kagbo wuncina na,
 And worship others than Allah- such as have no power of providing them for sustenance with anything in heavens or earth and cannot possibly have such power,Amae jin bauta ya yandoci najin Sokoa na na ma de mulki arziki ndondo yaa wo dagan sanmazhio ko kinboa na har amaa laa saajin ade kagbo wuncina na
 Invent not similitudes for Allah for Allah knoweth and ye know not,Ebo acino Ega tswa yandocizhi a pa Soko baci ma Hakika Soko yibe kpikpe yandondoe ye ma de kpikpea
 Allah sets forth the Parable of two men one a slave under the dominion of another He has no power of any sort and the other a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favours from Ourselves and he spends thereof freely privately and publicly are the two equal By no means praise be to Allah But most of them understand not,Soko ma la misali be yan wuzhi ndoci nama ejinu mulki jin na wyuntso ma de iko ta eti yandondo boa uciu la san tatu be zandoci nama yi yau arziki wangi nama dokun na ucie wu dagan mini arzikiubo to swiswoci to gbagba Ngba zagubaba nanazhi gaazhe yeni Yebo kpataajin tabbata ya Soko amaade ekun dondo azhi ade kpikpea
Allah sets forth another Parable of two men one of them dumb with no power of any sort a wearisome burden is he to his master whichever way be directs him he brings no good is such a man equal with one who commands Justice and is on a Straight Way,Soko ma ke la misali yan eza bagi guba ndocizhi be-be zaeni miniabo edingi uyio ude iko ta eti yandondo boa uciazhe kara wyuna yakpe ndakatau baenio bandondo nama aga zheu lo na wyunala alheri ndondo be woa Ngba zawuncin gaajin daidai be za naejin zawangizhi foro be jin jin alheri na uma kezhe ta eti ekpa natso yi gboro nao A a ngan ajin ye nia
To Allah belongeth the Mystery of the heavens and the earth And the Decision of the Hour of Judgment is as the twingkling of an eye or even quicker for Allah hath power over all things,Soko gama wun kpikpe yannazhi swofi sanmazhio to kinbo nao Alamari Alkiyami ma ufea sai de ke eyeba na koma yanna tsoba ganacin na Alkiyamia jina ni Hakika Soko de iko ta eti yandondo
It is He Who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when ye knew nothing and He gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affections that ye may give thanks to Allah,Soko ga ma wa ye dzun tinya dagan ewan nnayezhi bo kanga yede kpikpe yandondoa ucia ganwo to eyan bacin le to yangban jin yaye Ujin wo be wunciny ye gafe zanazhie jin yebo Soko na
Do they not look at the birds held poised in the midst of the air and the sky Nothing holds them up but the power of Allah Verily in this are signs for those who believe,Kashi acinle lo eba elugia kendoe Soko jina foro fi sarari sanmao naa yandondo ma danbo na la gwa suna naa sai de iko Sokoa Hakika mini wuncino egwa wu yan zankpe Soko zhi danbo ya zanazhi ga imani jin na
It is Allah Who made your habitations homes of rest and quiet for you and made for you out of the skins of animals tents for dwellings which ye find so light and handy when ye travel and when ye stop in your travels and out of their wool and their soft fibres between wool and hair and their hair rich stuff and articles of convenience to serve you for a time,Soko gayi Etsu na la efa be yaye mini emiyezhio nao u cike jin emizhi yaye dagan mini epa dabbazhio yecie fan yane efona ye gaa da zan na ye mae kana efona yegacin na gancin ma dagan mini tinyin yan kingbagbao to tinyin rakum to tinyin nangikarozhi ye de eyan ninpa yan yantacizhi miniabo be eyan eman-wozhi yan lokaci degi
It is Allah Who made out of the things He created some things to give you shade of the hills He made some for your shelter He made you garments to protect you from heat and coats of mail to protect you from your mutual violence Thus does He complete His favours on you that ye may bow to His Will in Islam,Soko gama jin wuruzhi yaye dagan mini yannazhi ujin alittazhi na bo ucia katazhi jin yaye dagan mini patizhio ucia ewozhi tufuwazhi jin yaye nahie kangwa ba yi pa yaye na to ewo nazhie kangwa eyan dedezhi ya ye na ke lokaci ekunzhi na Acinga ga sokoajin ugun niimauzhi mi yaye yeo ujin wo be wuncin-y yegafe zanazhie ta kpatsun -- foro Soko na
But if they turn away thy duty is only to preach the clear Message,Ammaa aga bea zunma zheta to yandondo ta eti wyoboa sai de eyan wu natso yi gbangba na
 They recognise the favours of Allah then they deny them and most of them are creatures ungrateful,Atso yibe kpikpe yan niima Sokoe gancin aciafe gbomi eba bojinazhio ekun dondoa ma kafirizhi ayio
 One Day We shall raise from all Peoples a Witness then will no excuse be accepted from Unbelievers nor will they receive any favours,Wyo mao feo pa Efo na yiga eri jinci laa nakin dagan mini alumma ndondo na gancin ma a jin izini ya zanazhi jin kafirincina ganata uzuria amaa -- uzuriazhio tsoa
 When the wrong-doers actually see the Penalty then will it in no way be mitigated nor will they then receive respite,Kamina ma azwalumizhi ga azaba leye na to ajin sauki ya aa amaa shi tukpa ya aa
 When the wrong-doers actually see the Penalty then will it in no way be mitigated nor will they then receive respite,Kamina ma azwalumizhi ga azaba leye na to ajin sauki ya aa amaa shi tukpa ya aa
 When those who gave partners to Allah will see their partners they will say Our Lord! these are our ´partners´ those whom we used to invoke besides Thee But they will throw back their word at them and say Indeed ye are liars!,Kamina zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci na aga bea yannazhi e la pa Soko baci na leye na a gangan Ya wyoe Tsoci yi!

That Day shall they openly show their submission to Allah and all their inventions shall leave them in the lurch,Efo wuncin atso ga kpatsun ta ya Soko gancin yannazhi afe tswa yan ganmanazhi na ci ga gbina yeo
Those who reject Allah and hinder men from the Path of Allah - for them will We add Penalty to Penalty for that they used to spread mischief,Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na acia eko yan bauta jin ya Soko te na to yia bea azaba ta eti azabao ebo iri etun dede nazhi afe lo nao
One day We shall raise from all Peoples a witness against them from amongst themselves and We shall bring thee as a witness against these thy people and We have sent down to thee the Book explaining all things a Guide a Mercy and Glad Tidings to Muslims,Wyo mao pa fona Yi gaala erijinci nakin dagan mini alumma ndondo na uci gaa eri ya etiabo gancin Yiciga wyo Muhammadu SAW laatinya ebo wyo-o yari eti zananazhio Yi maa Litafi cin be a ya wyoe ebo ulau fe bayani u ya yandondo Uma yi bawu be yeguni be yangbanfae ya musulumizhi
 Allah commands justice the doing of good and liberality to kith and kin and He forbids all shameful deeds and injustice and rebellion He instructs you that ye may receive admonition,Hakika Sokoe jin ye foro be adalinci jin-y to be jinjin boloboloe to be taimako laya eza tson bazhi Soko ma na etun zunyesun vo to etun dede to zwalunci jinwyune jin ye gangba ujin wo be wuncin-y ye gaafe zanazhie -- sinsantu na
Fulfil the Covenant of Allah when ye have entered into it and break not your oaths after ye have confirmed them indeed ye have made Allah your surety for Allah knoweth all that ye do,Ye mae fe e la alkawali Sokoe she kandondo na ye ga alkawali jin na ye mae ga fe lo kutizhi yezhi yama bacina ye gau bgboka na ma alalima yetso Soko laajin Erijinci danbo Hakika Soko yibe kpikpe etun nazhi ye lo na
 If Allah so willed He could make you all one people But He leaves straying whom He pleases and He guides whom He pleases but ye shall certainly be called to account for all your actions,Da umaa ba Soko ba da uga ye laazhe alumma nini be adini nini-y ammade wyune gbin zana gabau na umae la zana ga bauna ke eko Hakika ma Sokoa gbin ye gan eti etun nazhi ye lo kpata na
And take not your oaths to practise deception between yourselves with the result that someone´s foot may slip after it was firmly planted and ye may have to taste the evil consequences of having hindered men from the Path of Allah and a Mighty Wrath descend on you,Ye mae ga la kutizhi yezhi ajin dozhi hainci ma kacana biciezhi gaa taya baci na wuna wanshi dan kin bo na ye maafin azaba ebo eko Soko nazhi ye te na azaba na gbota na gaajin tabbata yaye
Nor sell the covenant of Allah for a miserable price for with Allah is a prize far better for you if ye only knew,Ye mae ga kun alkawali Soko yeahi eyan tetengi izhe ma hakika yan na dan be Sokoe na ugade alheri ya ye gano ye gafe zanazhi de kpikpe de na
What is with you must vanish what is with Allah will endure And We will certainly bestow on those who patiently persevere their reward according to the best of their actions,Yandondo naga dan be yeyin na ugaa zo yanna ma dan be Sokoena wuna zoa hakika ma yia ga zanazhi jin hankuri be foro Sokoena gba be egagba na gye gan etun nazhi afe lo nae
 Whoever works righteousness man or woman and has Faith verily to him will We give a new Life a life that is good and pure and We will bestow on such their reward according to the best of their actions,Zaeni ndondo naga lotun wangi mini bagio ko yinzagi na alalima uyi mumini na yia yau izhe le nayi lilicina yi maa gaa gba be egagba na gyegan etun nazhi alo na
 When thou dost read the Qur´an seek Allah´s protection from Satan the rejected one,Kandondo na wyo gaa gba Alkuranu na wa etswa be Sokoe dagan egun shetan nayi eza cice yaci na
 No authority has he over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord,Hakika wyuny shaitan ude iko ndoci ta eti za nazhia imani jin aciafe zanazhie yakpe Tsocia zhi na boaSurah  His authority is over those only who take him as patron and who join partners with AllahHakika ikou de ta eti zanazhie daya beu yin nae zanazhie pa ma beuyin na
 When We substitute one revelation for another- and Allah knows best what He reveals in stages- they say Thou art but a forger but most of them understand not,Yi ma ga aya ndoci sangwa be aya ndoci Soko ga ma de kpikpe gano yan yannazhi wyune cin be nao ajin agan gan Hakika ganmana zunci tsa wyo yio Aa ujin acina ekundondoazhi made kpikpea
Say the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from thy Lord in Truth in order to strengthen those who believe and as a Guide and Glad Tidings to Muslims,Gangan Ruhul-kudusi Malaika Jibrilu ga cinube dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo be gaskiy yino eboula kagbo be yangbanshiu ya zanazhia imani jin na umayi bawu be yangban fae ya musulumizhi
We know indeed that they say It is a man that teaches him The tongue of him they wickedly point to is notably foreign while this is Arabic pure and clear,Hakika ma yi kpe kee gan gan zawangi ndoci tsae wuu katuno Gancinma zhimi yan zana ekan hankali lo ebau na ajamiu yio ujin larabcia Alkluranu nana ma zhimi uyio yan larabci na yi gbangba na
 Those who believe not in the Signs of Allah- Allah will not guide them and theirs will be a grievous Penalty,Hakika zanazhi jin imani be aya Sokozhi yina na Sokoa laa ke ekoa azaba na ma tan na gajin tabbata yaa
 It is those who believe not in the Signs of Allah that forge falsehood it is they who lie!,Hakikade zanazhie tswa ganmana na aga yi zanazhi jin imani be Soko yinanao zanazhi-ma kondaa ma ganmana zuncizhi ayio
Any one who after accepting faith in Allah utters Unbelief- except under compulsion his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast to Unbelief on them is Wrath from Allah and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty,Zaeni ndondo na ga jin kafirinci be Sokoe baci yan imaniu bo na wuna jin hallaka sai de zana aga be jinu tile be kpakae alalima yangban wyuna shi be imani na ammaa zana ga kafirinci --ucia fedun danu yangbano na to ewunzhe yan Soko gaajin tabbata yau azaba nama gbota na gaajin tabbata yau
This because they love the life of this world better than the Hereafter and Allah will not guide those who reject Faith,Wuncin mayi ebona afe zanazhie wa edunfe izhe a gan yan eku nao hakika ma Sokoe jin jamaa yan kafirizhi shiria
Those are they whose hearts ears and eyes Allah has sealed up and they take no heed,Zawuncinzhi agayi zanazhi Sokoa yangbanazhi to gan woazhi to bacinleazhi te nao zawuncinzhi ma agayi eye yacizhio
Without doubt in the Hereafter they will perish,Kelo kezhin ndondo danboa kede hakika a zawuncizhi Efo zobae agayi eza hasarazhio naa
But verily thy Lord- to those who leave their homes after trials and persecutions- and who thereafter strive and fight for the faith and patiently persevere- Thy Lord after all this is oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Gancin ma hakika Tsoci wyoe Taimako jinci uyio ya zanazhi ga bea kpela baci yan fitina na cin dana nao gancin ma ajin hakuri na hakika Tsoci wyoe baci wuncino Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
One Day every soul will come up struggling for itself and every soul will be recompensed fully for all its actions and none will be unjustly dealt with,Wyo mao pa Fo na rayi ndondo atinya cia fe gbomi ya eti tacinu na ama ga egagba yan etun na rayi ndondo ga lo na laa yau amaa jina zwaluncia
Allah sets forth a Parable a city enjoying security and quiet abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place Yet was it ungrateful for the favours of Allah so Allah made it taste of hunger and terror in extremes closing in on it like a garment from every side because of the evil which its people wrought,Soko ma la misali yan jamaa yan alkarya ndoci be afe dan mini amincio be yangbanshi arzikiazhi cae be yaa be bagwoe dagan kansanta ndondo aci bea jin kafirinci be niima Soko zhiSoko ci yaa masiba yan azaba madan be dansuny fin ebo etun nazhi afe lo na

And there came to them a Messenger from among themselves but they falsely rejected him so the Wrath seized them even in the midst of their iniquities,Hakika ma Tuci be yaa dagan mini abo aciu yi ganmana zunci azaba cia cin taa alali ma a fe azwalumi zhi
So eat of the sustenance which Allah has provided for you lawful and good and be grateful for the favours of Allah if it is He Whom ye serve,Ye mae gi yangici halali nayi lilici na dagan mini arziki na Soko ga la yaye nao ye mae fe jin yebo be niima Soko na ye gi na wunayi gan hakika Soko ga ye jin bauta yao na
He has only forbidden you dead meat and blood and the flesh of swine and any food over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits- then Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Yannade u lajin haramu yaye na agayi eyan tsutsucio be egyae be nakan kpuutsuny be yanna azun be sunna yandoci najin Sokoa na ammaa zana tile bo gabe de na uci giuma jin eti shahawa ko gbingbintu boana to hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
But say not - for any false thing that your tongues may put forth- This is lawful and this is forbidden so as to ascribe false things to Allah For those who ascribe false things to Allah will never prosper,Ye mae gafe gangan be iri yan na gintara ye gae jiye yaye yan ganmana nama ye gafe gangan nana yi halali nana mayi haramu na ma kawanyin ebode ye tswa gan manae ta Soko hakika zanazhie tswa ganmana ta Soko na a tso guria
In such falsehood is but a paltry profit but they will have a most grievous Penalty,Eman wo yan izhe nana degi ga a wo wuno azaba nama tan na gaajin tabbata yaa
To the Jews We prohibited such things as We have mentioned to thee before We did them no wrong but they were used to doing wrong to themselves,Yimaa yannazhi yi ya wyo labaria daa na lajin haramu ya yahuduzhi shidzo be dzo yima jina zwaluncia amaade atso tsae jin ti tacina zwaluncio
But verily thy Lord- to those who do wrong in ignorance but who thereafter repent and make amends- thy Lord after all this is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Gancin ma hakika Tsoci wyoe Etsu gafara uyio ya zanazhi ga lotun dede eti rakpe bo eti jahilincio aci jin kparanyin dajin tuba baci wuncio na acia edzuta ladan rayuwaabo na hakika Tsuci wyoe baci wuncino Etsu gafara uyio yegun uyio

 He showed his gratitude for the favours of Allah who chose him and guided him to a Straight Way,Eza uyio nae jin yebo ya niima Soko nao Sokou tsa uciu wuba lo eko natso yi gboro na
 And We gave him Good in this world and he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous,Yima yan yetun yan bolobolo izheo hakika ma Efo Alkiyamio udan mini za guruzhio
So We have taught thee the inspired Message Follow the ways of Abraham the True in Faith and he joined not gods with Allah,Gancin ma yijin wahayi ya wyoe kede wyo lamiotu ekpa adini yan Ibrahima natso yi gboro na uma fedan mini zanazhie la yan Soko baci na boa
The Sabbath was only made strict for those who disagreed as to its observance But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment as to their differences,A cinwan la ya Asibi laa ta eti zanazhi cedozhi leba etiu bo na hakikama Tsoci wyo yaajin hukunci tsakaniabo Efo Alkiyami eti yannazhi e cedozhi leba dan miniubo na
Invite all to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious for thy Lord knoweth best who have strayed from His Path and who receive guidance,Yi zazhi lo eko Tsoci wyoe be hikimae to waazi nayi wangi na wyo mao gbomi beayin be egan natso gye gan nae Hakika Tsoci wyoe tsa kpe gano yan za naagbin ke ekou lugwanao wyunga ma kpe zanazhi kpe ekpo gboro o na gano

 And do thou be patient for thy patience is but from Allah nor grieve over them and distress not thyself because of their plots,Wyo mao jin hakuri eti yandondo na ga tswan wyo na hakuri maaye jina saide be taimako Sokoe wyo mao ga nyin yangban beayin ma wyo mao ga pin yangban be iri makirinci nazhie pa na ma

For Allah is with those who restrain themselves and those who do good,Hakika Soko dan be zanazhi gae sundan Soko acie tswau na to zanazhi gae jin bolo bolo na
Glory to Allah Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque whose precincts We did bless- in order that We might show him some of Our Signs for He is the One Who heareth and seeth all things ,Lili kpataajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu na la wuzhiu Annabi Muhammadu dazan Israi dan yeshio dagan masallaci alfurma yan makao lo masallaci na lokpa gan yan kudus ona na ma yia albarka laa mau -- ba eboma yi la zankpe ndocizhi wuu na Hakika Soko Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu na mae le yandondo ye yandondo ye na uyio

O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried in the Ark with Noah! Verily he was a devotee most grateful,Ya ye zuriya zanazhi yi ku keba be Nuhu-I fi eyao na Hakika wyunafe wuzhi nae dokun be yebo jin ya Soko jin ya Sokona
And We gave Clear Warning to the Children of Israel in the Book that twice would they do mischief on the earth and be elated with mighty arrogance and twice would they be punished!,Yicia kpa ya Bani Israila zhi dan mini Litafi Attaurao Hakika ye yea nyin yan fi kinbo zu guba ye maa be lati danfino eti ladanfino na wancin na nade tsanani na
 When the first of the warnings came to pass We sent against you Our servants given to terrible warfare They entered the very inmost parts of your homes and it was a warning completely fulfilled,To kamina alkawali yan eyan nyin ye yan mafari gabe dabe na yin tun wuzhi yi ndocizhi nazhi gboka tsuntsun nu na fi ye aci gabanfi nin yan katatako emi yezhio nana ma alkawali uyio nagaajin tabbata na

 If ye did well ye did well for yourselves if ye did evil ye did it against yourselves So when the second of the warnings came to pass We permitted your enemies to disfigure your faces and to enter your Temple as they had entered it before and to visit with destruction all that fell into their power,Ye ga bejin bolobolo to eti tacine gaejin bolobolo yao ye ma ga jin dede eti tacine gaejin yao To kamina alkawali yan eyan nyin ye yan zoba gabe dabe na kanga makiri zhia eboa debaajin ye walakanci acia kezhea gandan masallaci yan Baitul makadisio kendoe agandan bo caba batsozhio na aciga yandondo naejin mulki be yin na banya jigi jigi baenio
 It may be that your Lord may yet show Mercy unto you but if ye revert to your sins We shall revert to Our punishments And we have made Hell a prison for those who reject all Faith,Kengi uyio na Tsociye wyuna gun ye ye nao Ammaa yega kega kezhe dezhin lulo etun dede be yitso maadazhin be azabae be Yimaa jahannama laa zhe yantaci ya kafirizhi

And to those who believe not in the Hereafter it announceth that We have prepared for them a Penalty Grievous indeed,Hakikama zanazhie ya gaskiya be Efo zobayinana yi yia tattali jin yaa yan azaba na tan na
The prayer that man should make for good he maketh for evil for man is given to hasty deeds,Zawangi maajin ufe ba adwuwa dede ya eti tacinu kendoe wyune ba alheri na zawangi maafe eyedinci
We have made the Night and the Day as two of Our Signs the Sign of the Night have We obscured while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you that ye may seek bounty from your Lord and that ye may know the number and count of the years all things have We explained in detail,Yimaa yeshi to batin laazhe aya guba yicia aya yeshi laazhe zhiko shi yicia aya yan batin laazhe haske ebo yedebae wa bagwo dagan eba Tsoci yebo ebo ma ye kpe lisafi eyezhie ye be lisafi eyanbazhi Yandondo ma yiu kpeyezhizhi kpala kpalae

Who receiveth guidance receiveth it for his own benefit who goeth astray doth so to his own loss No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an messenger to give warning,Zana gaa ke eko na to uke eko ke ya ti tacinu zana ma gaa gbin na u gbin gbin ya tiu Zandondo madanbo naa la kara lefi yan zandondo naa yi mae jin zawangi zhi azabaa sai de yiga Tuci tun fia bedzo
When We decide to destroy a population We first send a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress so that the word is proved true against them then it is We destroy them utterly,Yi ma gaa kpa gan yiajin alkarya ndoci hallaka yiajin yijin za koazhi wancin yanazhi foro be tun guru loe acigaa leba afe lotun dedezhi fikinbo gancin hukunci azaba cigaajin tabbata ta etiabo yi ci gaajin hallaka baenio

 When thou dost recite the Qur´an We put between thee and those who believe not in the Hereafter a veil invisible,Kamindondo nama wyogae gba Alkuranu na Yiajin yie la yekan yan asiriso laadan tsakani wyobo be zanazhiejin imania na
And We put coverings over their hearts and minds lest they should understand the Qur´an and deafness into their ears when thou dost commemorate thy Lord and Him alone in the Qur´an they turn on their backs fleeing from the Truth,Yicia kpere ndoci laakpea yangbao ebo ma aga deba jin fahimta Alkuranu ma yimae la ekpinlu ndoci laaguna tukpaazhio Kamina ma wyoga Tsoci wyoe tunye mini Alkuranuo wyungbaugi na wyoa leaye aga zunma zheta aciga kpeya be gaskiyae
 We know best why it is they listen when they listen to thee and when they meet in private conference behold the wicked say Ye follow none other than a man bewitched!,Yima kpe gan zandondo yan kendoe Alkuranuajin ufe poa na kamina agae shitukpa ya gbigba wyoe yan Alkuranu na to kamina atso gae baza swiswoci na kamina azwalumizhi gae gangan Ngba yede zando lamitua sai de eyan manci
 See what similes they strike for thee but they have gone astray and never can they find a way,Wyotso cin le kendoe ela misaliazhi be kanma eti wyobo na har atsoa gbin amaade iko yan kpikpe eko gboro bea
They say What! when we are reduced to bones and dust should we really be raised up to be a new creation,Ama ci gan Ngba yiga bea fe tsukunzhi yicia gi yazo fi kinbo ngba aga yi la nakin yi la yzhe alitta woro ndocizhi be
Say Nay! be ye stones or iron,Gan yaa gan wyuna bae yeazhe takun koma yankpa sai Soko gae la nakin
Or created matter which in your minds is hardest to be raised up- Yet shall ye be raised up! then will they say Who will cause us to return Say He who created you first! Then will they wag their heads towards thee and say When will that be Say May be it will be quite soon!,Koma yeazhe alitta ndondo nagae gbota fi yangban yezhio na hakika sai agae la nakin Alkyamio Gancin acia gangan To zi yi wuncin naa ye yi lazhin rayi nao Gangan Etsu wuncin na ca jinjin ye tun dagan cabao na gancin acia fedu ti ya wyoe acia gan gan Foci alamari nana maa feo Gangan ujin wo ulaujin tabbata umaayi be ekpalo ndoci yina na
 It will be on a Day when He will call you and ye will answer His call with words of His praise and ye will think that ye tarried but a little while!,Efo na wyunayi ye na yetso cia yeu yebo jin-y-yau yecia fe kpaye gan ye fedun kabaria sai de yan lokaci degi
 Say to My servants that they should only say those things that are best for Satan doth sow dissensions among them For Satan is to man an avowed enemy,Wyoma gano ya wuzhi Mi zhi gan Aga gangan a gan natso ga gyegan na hakika shetan wyune nyin yan dan tsakaniabo Hakika shetan wyunafe makiri yan gbangba ya zawangi
It is your Lord that knoweth you best If He please He granteth you mercy or if He please punishment We have not sent thee to be a disposer of their affairs for them,Tsoci ye ukpe ye ye gan eti tacin yetso wyuna bau wyuna gun ye ye koma wyuna bau wyuna jine azaba Yima tun wyo tun fia gan wyo feo tswaao zaa
 And it is your Lord that knoweth best all beings that are in the heavens and on earth We did bestow on some prophets more and other gifts than on others and We gave to David the gift of the Psalms,Tsoci wyoe ga ma kpe gano be iri alitta nazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na Hakika ma yia daraja laa ya Annabi ndocizhi ta eti ndocizhio Yima Litafi zabura laa ya Dawuda
 Say Call on those - besides Him - whom ye fancy they have neither the power to remove your troubles from you nor to change them,Gan yaa gan E yi zanazhi ye yiye gan agayi Tsociyezhi zunma Soko na ade kagbo ndondo naaga la egun ndoci keyabo ya ye wo naa ama zheugba woa
Say Call on those - besides Him - whom ye fancy they have neither the power to remove your troubles from you nor to change them,Gan yaa gan E yi zanazhi ye yiye gan agayi Tsociyezhi zunma Soko na ade kagbo ndondo naaga la egun ndoci keyabo ya ye wo naa ama zheugba woa
 Those whom they call upon do desire for themselves means of access to their Lord - even those who are nearest they hope for His Mercy and fear His Wrath for the Wrath of thy Lord is something to take heed of,Zawuncinzhi nazhi kafiri zhie ba yan be yin na atsoe wa ekpa wa na agade tsonba Tsoci gan na zi maade tsonba Soko gano Amaejin kauna yegun Soko amae sundan azabau hakika azaba Tsoci wyoe eyan dansun uyio
There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty that is written in the eternal Record,Amade alkarya ndondoa sai de yi gaujin hallaka kafi Efo Alkiyami na koma Yiajinu azaba azaba na gbota na Wuncin maajin tabbata kikaci dan mini litafio
And We refrain from sending the signs only because the men of former generations treated them as false We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes but they treated her wrongfully We only send the Signs by way of terror and warning from evil,Yandoci ma kan yi ci tun ayazhi fiye yina yana sai de ebo na za mafari nazhi ala tunza fi na uuyi ganmana na yi ma la rakum ya Samuduzhi nae wu gbangba yan zankpe Soko na acia eti tacina jin gun beu yin yi ma e la ayazhi wua sai de ebo danlio
 Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about We granted the vision which We showed thee but as a trial for men- as also the Cursed Tree mentioned in the Qur´an We put terror and warning into them but it only increases their inordinate transgression!,Wyo mao pa kamina Yi gan wyo gan Hakika kpikpe Tsoci wyoe wuna zawangizhi kpata ma-kezhe E yan nazhima yi lawu wyoe lokaci Israi na yi lau fea sai de fitina be mimancinle ya zawangizhi to cigban naabomi dan mini Alkuranuo na Yimae lia dansun amaade ubea yandondoa sai de gbingbintu na wancin na
Behold!

He said Seest Thou this is the one whom Thou hast honoured above me! If Thou wilt but respite me to the Day of Judgment I will surely bring his descendants under my sway - all but a few!,Ugan Wyo ma le ye zanna Adama na wyo wancin ta eti mibo na hakika wallahi wyo ga pata rayi ya mi har da Efo Alkiyami miga zuriyauzhi kpata jin hallaka sai za degi gaa gangwao
Allah said Go thy way if any of them follow thee verily Hell will be the recompense of you all- an ample recompense,Soko cigan Fe lo Yia pata yao amaa zandondo na ga mi tuo miniabo na to jahannama gaayi egagba ye o egagba namayi gungunci na
Lead to destruction those whom thou canst among them with thy seductive voice make assaults on them with thy cavalry and thy infantry mutually share with them wealth and children and make promises to them But Satan promises them nothing but deceit,Wyo mao din zana wyo gade kagbo dindin miniabo na be bere wyoyin wyomao dina be eyantuci wyozhi to be ekungunci wyozhi wyo mao da yan zun beayin dan mini dukiyaazhio to egiazhio wyo mao feo jina alkawali ke yandondoa jinana Shetan made alkawali ndoci ajina sai de eta
As for My servants no authority shalt thou have over them Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs,Hakika wuzhi Mizhi wyode kagbo ndoci ta etiabo Tsoci wyo ma a kunke na wyuna -- yandondo tswa na
When distress seizes you at sea those that ye call upon - besides Himself - leave you in the lurch! but when He brings you back safe to land ye turn away from Him Most ungrateful is man!,Egun ndoci gaa tswan ye ta eti eduo yan dasun yandondo na yegae yi ye kanga na gaa gbin ye yeo uci ga keye be Sokoe gancin kamina uga ye gangwa cia patu da kin na yea pan ke forou lugwa Hakika zawangi manaawoci uyio
Do ye then feel secure that He will not cause you to be swallowed up beneath the earth when ye are on land or that He will not send against you a violent tornado with showers of stones so that ye shall find no one to carry out your affairs for you,Kashi ye yea aminci yaya gan Sokoa kpan kansan ndoci yan kosun be kpe ye woa koma wyunatun takun-kozhi fie gancin ma ye ade zandoci naa gwogwa yaye naa
 Or do ye feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea and send against you a heavy gale to drown you because of your ingratitude so that ye find no helper Therein against Us,Kashi yea aminci yaya gan Soko ke la ye da ta eti eduo wo yan zubaci bea gancin uciatun efe na gbokana be fie uci gae jin hallaka fi eduo ebo kafirinci na ye jin na gancin ma ye ade zandoci naagbe yiza gan wyuna wa hakki ye ya ye naa
We have honoured the sons of Adam provided them with transport on land and sea given them for sustenance things good and pure and conferred on them special favours above a great part of our creation,Hakika ma Yia egi Adama zhi wancinYicia la kpe eti kosun bo be eduzhi Yici yaa arziki dagan mini eyan lilicizhio Yici twarya be darajazhi ta eti ekundondo yan zanazhi Yijin alitta na be eryatwa na wancin nae
 One day We shall call together all human beings with their respective Imams those who are given their record in their right hand will read it with pleasure and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least,Efo na yi gaayi zawangizhi tinya kakayin be dzoshiciazhi na gancin zandondo na aga Litafiu laayau be gwaalou yin na to zawuncizhia gba Litafia zhi amaa jina boshi ka tetengia
 But those who were blind in this world will be blind in the hereafter and most astray from the Path,Zandondo na ma gaafe yebonci dan izhe nanao na to ka ekuo yebonci ga wyunayio uma gaagbin baenio ke eko gaskiya lugwa
And their purpose was to tempt thee away from that which We had revealed unto thee to substitute in our name something quite different in that case behold! they would certainly have made thee their friend!,Kelo kezhin ndondo ma dan boa wuna tsoba naajin wyo fitina be yanna yi la jin wahayi ya wyo nae ebode wyo otswa yandoci ndoci wuno yayi kanga ma gaa la wyoe eyamancio
 And had We not given thee strength thou wouldst nearly have inclined to them a little,Kagan umajin ebona yia wyo laa kugikini be kagboe naa hakika da wuna ke degi na woa ya kansan yaa degina
In that case We should have made thee taste an equal portion of punishment in this life and an equal portion in death and moreover thou wouldst have found none to help thee against Us!,Kanga ma da yia yao azaba na kpebadozhi na fin izhe babo be azaba na kpeba dozhi na eba tsutsuo gancin ma wyoade zandondo naajino taimako ta eti yibo naa
 Their purpose was to scare thee off the land in order to expel thee but in that case they would not have stayed therein after thee except for a little while,Kelo kezhin ndondo ma danboa a tsoba na aga wyodu dan kinbo na ebode ala wyo yaa waa tinaya dagan miniubo da ama gau jinjin da amaa de edunfe miniubo zunma-wyo boa sai de yan lokaci degi
This was Our way with the messengers We sent before thee thou wilt find no change in Our ways,Nana gayi iri yan zanazhi yi tun-tun shi wyodzo dagan mini Tuci yizhio nao wyo maa tsun egbazhe ndondo dan ekpa yi boa
 Establish regular prayers - at the sun´s decline till the darkness of the night and the morning prayer and reading for the prayer and reading in the morning carry their testimony,A salla kugikini kamina igidi ga pan da yi lozun dagan ta cino na harda caba yan yeshi wyo mao dokun be kuranu gbae dan lokaci alfijirio hakika gbigba katun alfijiri asubaabo malaikazhie jinu ri
And pray in the small watches of the morning it would be an additional prayer or spiritual profit for thee soon will thy Lord raise thee to a Station of Praise and Glory!,Be yeshi ma wyo naokinojin salla nafila na wyotso tsa jin jinuna kengi uyio be wuncin-y Soko ga wyo laatu dan kinigi bao na zawangizhia fe jin yebo yana
Say O my Lord! Let my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honour and likewise my exit by the Gate of Truth and Honour and grant me from Thy Presence an authority to aid me,Wyo mao gangan Tsoci! Ami laagandan eko yan gaskiyao wyo mao la mi yano tinoya edzunba yan gaskiyao wyomao ya mi kagbo yan taimako dagan nko wyobo
 And say Truth has now arrived and Falsehood perished for Falsehood is by its nature bound to perishWyo mao gangan Gaskiya da beani ganmana maa la keya hakika acinga uyio ganmana yanna ga la keyabo na uyio,
 We send down stage by stage in the Qur´an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe to the unjust it causes nothing but loss after loss,Dagan mini Alkuranuo ma yie cin yanna yi gunsa be yegunI na ya muminizhi umaabe azwalumizhi yandondoa sai de asara
 Yet when We bestow Our favours on man he turns away and becomes remote on his side instead of coming to Us and when evil seizes him he gives himself up to despair!,Yima ga niima laa twarya ya zawangi wunajin wyuna pan ke gaskiya lugwa uciga kansanu zheta sharri egun ndoci magadeu wyunafe zanaa kauna ba be yegun Sokoe na
 Say Everyone acts according to his own disposition But your Lord knows best who it is that is best guided on the Way,Gangan Zandondou feulo tun eti ekpaubo Tsoci ye ma wyun tsa kpe zana ta eti eko bawuo nagano
They ask thee concerning the Spirit of inspiration Say The Spirit cometh by command of my Lord of knowledge it is only a little that is communicated to you O men!,Amae gbin wyogan eti rayio Gangan Rayi alamari uyio mini alamari nazhi dan mulki Tsoci mi bona ama la yandondo yaye mini kpikpe boa sai de tukpyagi
 If it were Our Will We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspirationthen wouldst thou find none to plead thy affair in that matter as against Us-,Be ma wallahi uga ba yiba hakika da yiga wahayi na yi la ya wyo na la keyabo gancin ma yiga acin jin wyoade zandoci naajin wyo taimakowo eti yibo naa
Except for Mercy from thy Lord for his bounty is to thee indeed great,Sai de yegun dagan eba Tsoci wyobo gaajino taimako Hakika eryatwa Soko na dan be wyo yin na na wancin na uyio
Say If the whole of mankind and Jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur´an they could not produce the like thereof even if they backed up each other with help and support,Gan ya gan Wallahi ka zawangizhi to jannuzhi gaa gunyekan ebo adebaala dozhin iri Alkuranu nanaa be dozhinu wunaye labe yaaa kada ma sashiazhi gaafe taimako jincizhi ya sashiazhi
 And We have explained to man in this Qur´an every kind of similitude yet the greater part of men refuse to receive it except with ingratitude!,Hakika ma wallahi yi jin bayanizhi yan misali iri ndondo ya zawangizhi dan mini Alkuranu nanao gancin ma zawangizhi navo naajin yandondo na saide kafirinci
 They say We shall not believe in thee until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth,Aci gan Yia ya gaskiya be wyoyina sai de wyo ga eyenuwan zhi latinya dagan kinbo naawo kpakparae na
Or until thou have a garden of date trees and vines and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst carrying abundant water,Koma wyode bata dobinazhi be inabizhi wyocio la nuwan zhio tinoya tacinabo nuwan maufeu lautinuya wangi
Or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces as thou sayest will happen against us or thou bring Allah and the angels before us face to face,koma wyo kpan sanmao kpeyi kendoe wyoe lawuna uciu feu kpanuzhin kansan kansano koma wyo be be Soko-otsoe to malaikazhi eye be ye
What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them was nothing but this they said Has Allah sent a man like us to be His Messenger,Yando ma danbo nakan zawangizhi imanijin kamina bawu be yaa naa Sai de egan naagan gan Ngba zawangi ga Sokoa tun fi yi Tucio
 Say If there were settled on earth angels walking about in peace and quiet We should certainly have sent them down from the heavens an angel for a messenger,Gan yaa gan Daacigan malaika fi kinbo fi cie dazan be yangban shi kpebo kezawangizhi na da Yima ga malaika tun be fia dagan sanmao naayi Tuci na
Say Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you for He is well acquainted with His servants and He sees all things,Gan yaa gan Sokoa kunke Eri dan tsakani mibo be ye yin Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio be yanna wuzhiuzhi dan-y-ninbo na Etsu na mae cinale na uyio
It is he whom Allah guides that is on true Guidance but he whom He leaves astray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him On the Day of Judgment We shall gather them together prone on their faces blind dumb and deaf their abode will be Hell every time it shows abatement We shall increase from them the fierceness of the Fire,Zana ma Soko gaa wuba na to zawuncin gayi ezabawuo zanama ugau gbin na wyoade ndakata ndoci naajina taimako zunma Soko naa Yima gaa la nakin Efo Alkiyami fuskazhima gaafe yan yebonci tukpa tenciedingi ezhekebaa gayi jahannamao kandondo na enau gae tana yia beu nagban
It is he whom Allah guides that is on true Guidance but he whom He leaves astray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him On the Day of Judgment We shall gather them together prone on their faces blind dumb and deaf their abode will be Hell every time it shows abatement We shall increase from them the fierceness of the Fire,Zana ma Soko gaa wuba na to zawuncin gayi ezabawuo zanama ugau gbin na wyoade ndakata ndoci naajina taimako zunma Soko naa Yima gaa la nakin Efo Alkiyami fuskazhima gaafe yan yebonci tukpa tenciedingi ezhekebaa gayi jahannamao kandondo na enau gae tana yia beu nagban
 That is their recompense because they rejected Our signs and said When we are reduced to bones and broken dust should we really be raised up to be a new Creation,Wuncin gayi egagbaao ebona hakika ajin kafirinci be ayayi nae aci gan Ngba yi gaa zhe tsunkunzhi yi cia ban ya fi kinbo ngba agayi san la daa alitta woro be
 See they not that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth has power to create the like of them anew Only He has decreed a term appointed of which there is no doubt But the unjust refuse to receive it except with ingratitude,Kashi a leye gan Soko najin sanmazhi to kin na uyi be kagaboe na wyunajin alitt iriazhi wo naa Uma lokaci yan zoba yandondo laacici yaa kelo kezhin ndondo madanboa gancin azwalumizhi ci na yandondo vo sai de kafirinci naajin na
Say If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord behold ye would keep them back for fear of spending them for man is every niggardly!,Gan yaa gan Daaci gan yegae jin mulki be edzunba arziki yan Tsoci mi zhiyino daye ga gwasunu na yea wu ya zazhia ebo dansun wuwu na yea wuu nao Zawangi maafe yanbotanci tsuru
To Moses We did give Nine Clear Signs As the Children of Israel when he came to them Pharaoh said to him O Moses! I consider thee indeed to have been worked upon by sorcery!,Hakika yi la aya gbangbazhi har gutwani aya Musa wyo mao gbin Banu Israilazhi gan kamina ube yaa na Firauna cia gan yau gan Hakika wyoe Musa mie le wyo ye eza naajin shiri na
Moses said Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence and I consider thee indeed O Pharaoh to be one doomed to destruction!,Musa gan Hakika wyotso kpe ujin zandondo cin aya nanazhi bea sai de Tsoci najin sanmazhi to kin na ebo wyo-ole zankpeuzhi ye gbangbae Hakika mie kpa wyo ye wyo Firauna ke eza hallaka wyo yio na
So he resolved to remove them from the face of the earth but We did drown him and all who were with him,Ucia kpa gan wyuna dua dan kin yan Misrao Yiciu jin hallaka gun eduo to zanazhie pama beu yin na baenio
And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel Dwell securely in the land of promise but when the second of the warnings came to pass We gathered you together in a mingled crowd,Yicia gan be Banu Israilazhi zun maubo gan Eda fedun dan kin yan Falastinuo gancin kamina alkawali yan Efo Alkiyami gaa kun na yia be beyeyin baenio
We sent down the Qur´an in Truth and in Truth has it descended and We sent thee but to give Glad Tidings and to warn sinners,Ebo tswitswo gaskiyabo acin Alkuranuo be gaskiyae gama ucin beo Yima tun wyo tun-tua saide ebo wyo ya muminizhi labari yangbanfa wyo maojin kafirizhi gangba
It is a Qur´an which We have divided into parts from time to time in order that thou mightest recite it to men at intervals We have revealed it by stages,Alkuranu ma Yiu kpe kakayin ebo wyo-ogba wuno ya zawangizhi karayin be hankali Yima cinu cin be gwargwado yan uzuri be bukatae
Say Whether ye believe in it or not it is true that those who were given knowledge beforehand when it is recited to them fall down on their faces in humble prostration,Gan yaa gan Ko ye la imaniejin beu yin koma ye gajin ma ye ni uyio Hakika zanazhi ala ilimi ya shiudzona kamina agae gbau yaa na ajin e laa yashi kinbo be ekpyadae acia jin ada sujada
And they say ´Glory to our Lord! Truly has the promise of our Lord been fulfilled!´,Acia jin agan gan Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Tsoci yi hakika alkawali Tsoci yi yan na gaafe na uyio
They fall down on their faces in tears and it increases their earnest humility,Acia jin e la fuskaazhi ladaa kin acia fe tigi uciajin ufe bea dansun Soko
Say Call upon Allah or call upon Rahman by whatever name ye call upon Him it is well for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names Neither speak thy Prayer aloud nor speak it in a low tone but seek a middle course between,Gan yaagan Efe yi Allahu ye aduwaebo koma Al-Rrahmanu ndondo na yega yi na Soko yi be sunna wangi wangizhi Wyo mao gaagan bere latu eba sallao ma wyo mao gaaganswo ma wyodeo wa tatacin tsakaniabo
 Say Praise be to Allah who begets no son and has no partner in His dominion Nor needs He any to protect Him from humiliation yea magnify Him for His greatness and glory!,Wyo mao gangan yebo kpataajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nade gia na umade emapaci eba mulki jin boa na umade ndakata ebo dansun egba ndoci naagikini yau naana wyo mao wanu cin cinwan nayi yan cinwanci kpata na
Praise be to Allah Who hath sent to His Servant the Book and hath allowed therein no Crookedness,Yebo kpataajin tabbata ya SokoEtsu nacin litafi be ya wuzhiu uma la egbakpan-ko kandanbo ndondo danboa na
He hath made it Straight and Clear in order that He may warn the godless of a terrible Punishment from Him and that He may give Glad Tidings to the Believers who work righteous deeds that they shall have a goodly Reward,Litafi uyio na yi gboro na ebou naebou na wun be azaba natso gbota dan nko Soko-ona Umau ya muminizhi nazhie lotun wangizhi na labari yangbanfa kede hakika egagba nayi wangi na gaajin tabbata yaa naSurah Wherein they shall remain for everAmaa fe dun fe fibo tutun yin
Further that He may warn those also who say Allah hath begotten a son,Umau jin zanazhi gan gan Soko yibe egiina gangba
No knowledge have they of such a thing nor had their fathers It is a grievous thing that issues from their mouths as a saying what they say is nothing but falsehood!,Ade kpikpe ndondo eti wuncin boa ka yanmanciazhi ma ade kpikpe wuncina Egan nazhi mae tinya misuna zhio na wuna gbota ade egan ndondoe-gana sai de ganmana
 Thou wouldst only perchance fret thyself to death following after them in grief if they believe not in this Message,KengiI ga keo na wyoga eti tacinno jin hallaka ebo bojinazhio be yangban yin yan imani na-ajin be Litafi na na yina nae
 That which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for the earth in order that We may test them - as to which of them are best in conduct,Hakika Yia yannazhi kpe eti kinbo kpatana laafe ninpa yau ebo YiI manae cin-y-leziI ga lotin wangi gano
Verily what is on earth we shall make but as dust and dry soil without growth or herbage,Hakika ma Yi gaa yannazhi kpetiubo kpata na laazhe jikanna nade anfani ndondoa na
Or dost thou reflect that the Companions of the Cave and of the Inscription were wonders among Our Sign,Kashi wyoe kpayekpa gan jamaa yan kpankoro zhi to yan elo zhi afefe dan mini aya Yizhi nazhi yi eyan mamaki nae
 Behold the youths betook themselves to the Cave they said Our Lord! bestow on us Mercy from Thyself and dispose of our affair for us in the right way!,Kamina egi gbarufu wuncinzhi dawa ecinba dan mini kpankoro na aci ganTsoci yi! Twa yi rya be yegun-y dagan eba Wyobo Wyo mao jin shirio yayi yan bawu dan mini alamari yan yi nanao
Then We draw a veil over their ears for a number of years in the Cave so that they heard not,Yi cia ekpinlu laadan tukpaazhio dan mini kpankoro aci fe le le yan eya nazhi dokun na
Then We roused them in order to test which of the two parties was best at calculating the term of years they had tarried!,Gancin Yicia san ebo Yi debay-laywu ziL mini jamaa gubaba nanazhio tswa hakika yan ekpaio yan edunfe zan nazhi kpankoro bo
 Then We roused them in order to test which of the two parties was best at calculating the term of years they had tarried!,Gancin Yicia san ebo Yi debay-laywu ziL mini jamaa gubaba nanazhio tswa hakika yan ekpaio yan edunfe zan nazhi kpankoro bo
 We relate to thee their story in truth they were youths who believed in their Lord and We advanced them in guidance,Yi gaa ya wyoe labari yan gaskiyaoHakika gbarufu zhi ayio nazhia imani jin be Tsocia yin nae Yi ma ci bea bawu
We gave strength to their hearts Behold they stood up and said Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth never shall we call upon any god other than Him if we did we should indeed have uttered an enormity!,Yi cia yangbanazhi gboka be imaniy kamina a kugikini acigan Tsoci yi wyun gayi Tsoci yan sanmazhi to kin yino yia jin bauta ya Tsoci ndoci zunmau boa kacina ngan yi gaazhe ganmana zuncizhi
These our people have taken for worship gods other than Him why do they not bring forward an authority clear and convincing for what they do Who doth more wrong than such as invent a falsehood against Allah,Za nana zhi jamaa yan Yizhi ayio nazhie jin bauta ya Tsoci ndoci ke Soko lugwa na kii la aci la dalili ndoci na gboka u mayi gbangbae na bea yino To ngba zii danbo na jin zwalunci kun za na da tswa ganmana ta Soko nao

Thou wouldst have seen the sun when it rose declining to the right from their Cave and when it set turning away from them to the left while they lay in the open space in the midst of the Cave Such are among the Signs of Allah He whom Allah guides is rightly guided but he whom Allah leaves to stray- for him wilt thou find no protector to lead him to the Right Way,Wyo maa le igidi ye kamina ugaa la tinya na ugaa pan ke kpankoroa lugwa lo gwaa-lo kamina uma gaada lo na wunajin ufe pan lo kasanta yan gwaapin ama fi tacinubo Wuncin dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko Zana Soko gaa wuba na to zawuncin gaa ke eko zana ma Ugau gbin na wyoade taimako jinci ndoci naa wuuba naa
Thou wouldst have deemed them awake whilst they were asleep and We turned them on their right and on their left sides their dog stretching forth his two fore-legs on the threshold if thou hadst come up on to them thou wouldst have certainly turned back from them in flight and wouldst certainly have been filled with terror of them,Wyo maafe leaye le ke zanazhia san-san zhibo na alalima ayi ele-yn-lere Yima ci fe zheaban lo kansanta gwaalo to kansanta gwaapin eshigia ma wuna biciuzhi gubabau ta zhi yegboro zhenpa yan kpankoro daa wyo gaashi ye shi ci cinale yagban wyo ma gaa she be dansun-y
Such being their state we raised them up from sleep that they might question each other Said one of them How long have ye stayed here They said We have stayed perhaps a day or part of a day At length they all said Allah alone knows best how long ye have stayed here Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours to the town let him find out which is the best food to be had and bring some to you that ye may satisfy your hunger therewith And let him behave with care and courtesy and let him not inform any one about you,Acinga ga yi be sanao ebo adebaa gbin dozhi gan eti ele leabo Egan gbinci miniabo ci gbin gan gan ki yi ekpalo edunfe ye babon na bo Aci gan yi fedun yan efo nini koma ke ganfi efo na Aci ke gan gan Tsoci ye tsa kpe hakika ekpalo edunfe yeyeo ebo acino yea zaeni miniebo tun daa zhi nin be ewo ye nanae udau cinule yangici kici tadzun gano gancin uciu beu yaye be yangici na yegaugi na be ewo wunci-y Umau jin karayin ebo zandondou gakpe iri eza na yeyi nama
For if they should come upon you they would stone you or force you to return to their cult and in that case ye would never attain prosperity,Hakika aga bea kpe gan ye fi bagao agae ce yan ko ma agae ku dafi adiniabo gancin ma yea tso guriezhi bea hardaa efo zoba

Thus did We make their case known to the people that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment Behold they dispute among themselves as to their affair Some said Construct a building over them Their Lord knows best about them those who prevailed over their affair said Let us surely build a place of worship over them,Acinga ga ma Soko be laa wu zawangizhio ebo adebaa kpeawo kede hakika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio na Alkiyami ma kelokezhin ndondo danboa Wyo mao pa kamina afe gbo mi be dozhi eti alamaria bo na acigan yea eba tu gi eko kpankoro wuncino Tsoci atso tsa kpe hakika alamaria yeo Zanazhi be de zankpe ta eti alamariabo na cigan Yi ga masallaci tu ta eti kabari a bo
Some say they were three the dog being the fourth among them others say they were five the dog being the sixth- doubtfully guessing at the unknown yet others say they were seven the dog being the eighth Say thou My Lord knoweth best their number It is but few that know their real case Enter not therefore into controversies concerning them except on a matter that is clear nor consult any of them about the affair of the Sleepers,Ndociazhi cie gan gan za guta ayio yan nicia gayi eshigiao Ndocizhi gan za gutsun ayio yan tsunayin cia ci yi eshigia acie banba dan mini bazhiko Ndocizhi cigan za gutwaba ayio yan totacia ma ugayi eshigiao Gan yaa gan  Tsoci mi tsa kpe hakika yan adadia yeo ade zanakpe hakika alamaria ye naa sai eza degi Ebo acino ga gbomi eti alamaria bo ma sai eti yannazhi ga dan filio na Wyo mao gada ya zandondo fatawa etiabo ma

Without adding So please Allah! and call thy Lord to mind when thou forgettest and say I hope that my Lord will guide me ever closer even than this to the right road,Sai dai wyo-o gan gan Uga bea ba Soko na Wyo mao pa Tsoci wyoe tanba gabe lo wyo na Wyo mao gan gan Mie jin kauna gan Sokoa wumi ba lo eko alheri natso ba nana na
 So they stayed in their Cave three hundred years and some add nine more,A ma ci fedun fi kpankoroa bo ekpalo yan eya kpako be shitsuny aci kezhe be gutwani ta etiubo be
 Say Allah knows best how long they stayed with Him is the knowledge of the secrets of the heavens and the earth how clearly He sees how finely He hears everything! They have no protector other than Him nor does He share His Command with any person whatsoever,Gangan Hakika Soko tsa kpe ekpalo yan eya naa fe nao Asiri kpata yan sanmazhi to kin yan wyinayio Zii danbo le baye dozhin Sokoo zii ma danbo na wo gan dozhinU nao Ade Ndakata ndoci zunma U boa uma pa ma be zandondoe eba hukunci jinu boa

And keep thy soul content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening seeking His Face and let not thine eyes pass beyond them seeking the pomp and glitter of this Life no obey any whose heart We have permitted to neglect the remembrance of Us one who follows his own desires whose case has gone beyond all bounds,Wyo mao ya titacin wyoe hakuri be edunfe zanazhie jin bauta ya Tsocia to laazhin to yeshi-na acie wa yedajin yan Tsocia za na wyo mao ga pan fuska wyoe dagan ebaabo ma ebo wiwa ninpa izheo ma wyo mao ga la mitu zana yia eyeya ce tau yangbano ke pipa Yi lugwa na ma zanaa emi tu etun yangban har ucia -- nugun gan na
 Say The truth is from your Lord Let him who will believe and let him who will reject it for the wrong-doers We have prepared a Fire whose smoke and flames like the walls and roof of a tent will hem them in if they implore relief they will be granted water like melted brass that will scald their faces how dreadful the drink!

 As to those who believe and work righteousness verily We shall not suffer to perish the reward of any who do a single righteous deed,Hakika zanazhia imani jin acie lotun wangizhi na aa de robo Hakika ma Yie ta egagba yan zanazhi ga lotun wangi na yaa
 For them will be Gardens of Eternity beneath them rivers will flow they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and they will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade They will recline therein on raised thrones How good the recompense! How beautiful a couch to recline on!,Zawuncinzhi Aljanna yan danbodan zhi gaajin tabbata yaa sangi nuwan zhi ciafe je fi tako aljannaazhio acigaa pa nin fi miniubo be zinariya zhi aci ga tufuwa nayi nuwan aliga aliga zhi na fan dagan mini ede siliki nayi gbwarwa-gbwarwa na to nayi tsanku tsanku na aci gaa kpetso ta eti gadoazhio madanla be egagba nanae ecinba wuncin maa gye
 Set forth to them the parable of two men for one of them We provided two gardens of grape-vines and surrounded them with date palms in between the two We placed corn-fields,Wyo mao jin kotoncin yaa be eza bagi ndocizhi gubae Yia zaeni miniabo ya batako guba yan inabizhi Yi cia ma -- ba be cigban dobinazhi Yi ci kezhe eyandzozhi laadan tacinabo
 Each of those gardens brought forth its produce and failed not in the least therein in the midst of them We caused a river to flow,Nni ndondo mini bata gubaba nanazhio wuna yangici sun-sunuzhi laatinya kendoe u -- yin na uma ke yandondo tukun boa gancin Yi cia nuwan edu la tinya dan tacinabo
Abundant was the produce this man had  he said to his companion in the course of a mutual argument more wealth have I than you and more honour and power in my following of men,Lati yan zaeni miniabo yi be yangici sun-sunzhi gancin ucia gan beuyin gan Mi gan wyoe ekundo dukiyao be kagbo yan jamaa zhi-y
He went into his garden in a state of mind unjust to his soul He said I deem not that this will ever perish,U cia gan dan latiubo umaafe zanaa eti tacinu jin zwalunci na uci gan Mi kpaye gan yangici nanazhi aa zo be tutun yina
 Nor do I deem that the Hour of Judgment will ever come Even if I am brought back to my Lord I shall surely find there something better in exchange,Be ma mi kpayetu gan ekin-na Alkiyamio tsoa danboa kada ma migaa zheban da eba Tsoci mi akika miade egwasan natso gye gan wuncinzhi na
His companion said to him in the course of the argument with him Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust then out of a sperm-drop then fashioned thee into a man,Eyau cia gan beuyin kamina ufe baza beuyin na Ngba wyo gaajin kafirinci be Etsu najin alita wyoe dagan jikan-nao na gancin Uci wao tinya dagan maniy-bo na Uci kezhea wyo jin dai dai wyo cia zhe eza gungunci nae
 But I think for my part that He is Allah My Lord and none shall I associate with my Lord,Ammaade mi Soko tsayi Tsoci mi yino mi maa la zandoci a pa Tsoci mi baciaSurah Why didst thou not as thou wentest into thy garden say ´Allah´s will be done! There is no power but with Allah!´ If thou dost see me less than thee in wealth and sonsEgan gan kamina wyo gandan lati wyo bo na wyo gan-gan Yandondo sai kendoe uga ba Soko na wuna feo kagbo ndondo ma danboa sai de be Sokoe Kaadaa wyo gae le ye le gan mi gbagba gan wyoe dukiyao to zuriyao
 It may be that my Lord will give me something better than thy garden and that He will send on thy garden thunderbolts by way of reckoning from heaven making it but slippery sand!-,To mide jin kauna gan Tsoci mi wyuna ya mi yanna gan lati wyo na Soko macin masiba ndoci dagan sanmao be dan lati wyo-bo uciu lau tinba ulaufe jikan-na nae ta zazhi ya na
Or the water of the garden will run off underground so that thou wilt never be able to find it,Koma nuwanu gaa tinba wiwoci wyo maa de eko ndoci na wyo gaade nuwan ndoci naa
 So his fruits and enjoyment were encompassed with ruin and he remained twisting and turning his hands over what he had spent on his property which had now tumbled to pieces to its very foundations and he could only say Woe is me! Would I had never ascribed partners to my Lord and Cherisher!,Acia latiu makezhe be hallakae gancin ucia tinba fe kogwa ro-- nkpe ti eti iri dukiya bididi na u wufi mini lati wuncino na alali ma lati kpaata agbin zhi kinbo baenio uci fe gan gan kaasa mi re!

Nor had he numbers to help him against Allah nor was he able to deliver himself,Umade jamaa kagboci ndoci naajinu taimako zunma Sokoo naa u ma jin za na ajin taimako-otso naaSurah  There the only protection comes from Allah the True One He is the Best to reward and the Best to give successEku batsozhi ma hakika mulki kpata yan Soko uyio wyun gayi Etsu nae dokun be laada la ya zae nao wyunga mayi Etsu nae gye zoba nao
 Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world It is like the rain which we send down from the skies the earth´s vegetation absorbs it but soon it becomes dry stubble which the winds do scatter it is only Allah who prevails over all things,Wyo mao yaa kotonci yan edunfe izhe kendoe uyi na ke nuwan na uyio na Yi duzhin dagan sanmao na gancin yandzo yan kin zhi cia bokeba beuyin gancin uci bea wo kpakparae efezhi cie kuuza kendoe bauna Soko ma Etsu Iiko uyio ta eti yandondo-o
 Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world But the things that endure good deeds are best in the sight of thy Lord as rewards and best as the foundation for hopes,Dukiya to egizhi ninpa edunfe izhe ayio etun wangi wangizhi nazhia danabo dan na ade alheri gan eba laadae a ga ma de alheri gan eba tswitso guri yan Alkiyami bo
 One Day We shall remove the mountains and thou wilt see the earth as a level stretch and We shall gather them all together nor shall We leave out any one of them,Wyo mao pa efo na Yiga patizhi la keyabo na wyo cia le kin ye cici parae tutunti ko edua danboa Yi ci gaa kuye kan baenio Yi maa lu ko zaeni miniabo gwaa
And they will be marshalled before thy Lord in ranks with the announcement Now have ye come to Us bare as We created you first aye ye thought We shall not fulfil the appointment made to you to meet Us!,Acia kuabe kuku yan zunyesun zhi yegboro Tsoci wyo bo safu-safu acia gana gan Hakika ye dabe eba Yi yia ni kendoe Yi ca jin jin alita ye na alaali ma ye fe la wu kede Yia la ezhekeba ndoci cici yaye yaa na
And the Book of Deeds will be placed before you and thou wilt see the sinful in great terror because of what is recorded therein they will say Ah! woe to us! what a Book is this! It leaves out nothing small or great but takes account thereof! They will find all that they did placed before them And not one will thy Lord treat with injustice,Aci ga litafi etunazhi ku zhizhi gancin wyocia le lefi jinci zhi ye dan mini dansuno ebo iri yannazhi fibo na acife gangan kaa sa yi re kici tso be fi litafi nanao beo u lu yandondo gwaa to tetengi to wanciko sai na wunu tswa kikaci na aci tsun yandondo naajin izheo na uu labe fibo Tsoci wyo ma wyunejin zaeni ndondo guna
 Behold! We said to the angels Bow down to Adam They bowed down except Iblis He was one of the Jinns and he broke the Command of his Lord Will ye then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me And they are enemies to you! Evil would be the exchange for the wrong-doers!,Wyo mao pakamina Yi gan ya malaikazhi gan E jin sujada ya Adamana aci daa sujada sai de Iblisu wyunafe dan mini jannuzhio ucia ce leba foro yan Tsoci Ngba yegaa la to zuriyauzhi masoyi zhi kemi lugwa alaalima makirizhi ayi ya ye yeo Gwasan yan azwalumizhi wuna biye
I called them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth nor even their own creation nor is it for helpers such as Me to take as lead men astray!,Mi kua ye kan zhizhi eti erio ci la jinjin sanmazhi to kin wuaa Mi ma la jinjin yan altaazhi tsozhi wu aa Mi ma fe za nae la eza gbinzhi taimako jinci zhi ya alamari Mi naa
 One Day He will say Call on those whom ye thought to be My partners and they will call on them but they will not listen to them and We shall make for them a place of common perdition,Wyo mao pa fo na Sokoa gan be kafirizhi na  E yi zanazhi yee laa pa Mi baci na beyn Acia yia ye amaa zhea gana Yi cia hallaka laadan tsakaniabo be dozhi
 And the Sinful shall see the fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein no means will they find to turn away therefrom,Lefi jinci zhi cia le ena ye gancin atso cia hakika ya kede agaa gan fi bo na amaade ebanzhe lo bandocia na
We have explained in detail in this Qur´an for the benefit of mankind every kind of similitude but man is in most things contentious,Hakika ma Yia bayani yan kotonci iri ndondo jin ya zawangizhi fi mini alkuranu nanao ammaade zawangi wunafe zana dokun gan yandondo eba emigbo-ona
And what is there to keep back men from believing now that Guidance has come to them nor from praying for forgiveness from their Lord but that they ask that the ways of the ancients be repeated with them or the Wrath be brought to them face to face,Amade yandoci na kan zawangizhi imani-y-jin kamina bawu be yaa naa acia kezhea ba gafara be Tsocia yin naa saide eyetu yan azaba iri na be ya za mafarizhi na koma azaba iri-iri naa be yaa na
 We only send the messengers to give Glad Tidings and to give warnings But the unbelievers dispute with vain argument in order therewith to weaken the truth and they treat My Signs as a jest as also the fact that they are warned!,Yi mae tun Tucizhi tun be bea saide ebo alaafe zanazhie ya labari yangbanfa na amaa laafe zanazhie na-wun na Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na ajin afe gbomi be hujja ganmanae ebode a la gaskiyaa to gbogun Gancin a cia aya Mizhi to yannazhi ala naa wun na la eyan emi-la
 And who doth more wrong than one who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord but turns away from them forgetting the deeds which his hands have sent forth Verily We have set veils over their hearts lest they should understand this and over their ears deafness if thou callest them to guidance even then will they never accept guidance,Zii gajin zwalunci a kun zana ala aya Tsociu zhi pau tukpa ucia zunma zhe tau nao uci kezhea tanba laalo dan iri etun dede nazhi ulo cia shidzo nao Hakika Yia kpere laakpea yangbanazhio ebo agade fahimta Alkuranu ma ekpinlu ndoci ma dan mini tukpaazhio e wo gaskiyaa Kaa wyo ma ga yia lo eko bawu aga ke ekoa har da zoba izhea
 But your Lord is Most forgiving full of Mercy If He were to call them at once to account for what they have earned then surely He would have hastened their punishment but they have their appointed time beyond which they will find no refuge,Tsoci wyo ma Etsu gafara uyio nayi Etsu yegun na daa ci gan wyune wana wan be iri etun dede nazhie lo na daa wyuna dinye din ci la azaba be jina Amaade alittazhi ayi be lokaci alkawali nayi bibaci na lokaci na a de ebanzhe lo bandoci bea na
Such were the populations we destroyed when they committed iniquities but we fixed an appointed time for their destruction,Alkarya wuncinzhi kpata Yiajin hallaka kamina ajin zwalunci na Yi cia lokaci bibaci laashi-shi yaa yan hallaka na Yia jina na
 Behold Moses said to his attendant I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or until I spend years and years in travel,Wyomao pa lokacina Musa gan ya egiu Mia pa ezan taa har sai miga tun egunba yan edu gubaba koma mia fe dazan yan eya na dokun na
But when they reached the Junction they forgot about their Fish which took its course through the sea straight as in a tunnel,Kamina abe tun egunba yan edu gubaaba na a ikana batan nama wa ekou kpan-yin lo gun eduo na
When they had passed on some distance Moses said to his attendant Bring us our early meal truly we have suffered much fatigue at this stage of our journey,Lokaci aa pa tu na Musa cia gan be egiu yin gan La yangici yi tinya hakika Yia gun be wahalae dan ezan yi nanao
He replied Sawest thou what happened when we betook ourselves to the rock I did indeed forget about the Fish none but Satan made me forget to tell you about it it took its course through the sea in a marvellous way!,Egi ci ganwyo leye kamina yi gun ta takuno na hakika mia ikan batan ci bagao amade yanna la tanba lo mi naa sai shetan ulugwa mi paa Ikan ci wa ekou dan mini eduo eyan mamaki
Moses said That was what we were seeking after So they went back on their footsteps following the path they had come,Musa ci gan wuncino tso gayi yanna yie waza nao Aci kezhea zheban daa zunma be acia mitu etaazhi ci fe lo
So they found one of Our servants on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves and whom We had taught knowledge from Our own Presence,Aci da tsun wuzhi ndoci mini wuzhi Yi zhio Yi twa wuzhi wuncin rya be yegun ndoci dagan eba Yibo ilimi nayi tsitsaci na
So they found one of Our servants on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves and whom We had taught knowledge from Our own Presence,Aci da tsun wuzhi ndoci mini wuzhi Yi zhio Yi twa wuzhi wuncin rya be yegun ndoci dagan eba Yibo ilimi nayi tsitsaci na
 Moses said to him May I follow thee on the footing that thou teach me something of the Higher Truth which thou hast been taught,Musa ci gan beuyin gan kashi min lamintu wyoe ebo wyo debao wu mi mini kpikpe bawu na Soko la wu wyo na
The other said Verily thou wilt not be able to have patience with me!,Uci gan Hakika wyoa jin hakuri wo be mi yina
 And how canst thou have patience about things about which thy understanding is not complete,Ke ma wuna zhezhe wyoci jin hakuri be yanna kpikpe wyoe uma kezhea naa yino
Moses said Thou wilt find me if Allah so will truly patient nor shall I disobey thee in aughtMusa ci gan ,Ugaa ba Soko wyoa tsun mi eza hakuri mi maa le foro wyo baa
The other said If then thou wouldst follow me ask me no questions about anything until I myself speak to thee concerning it,Ugan To wyo gami tu mi ga gbin mi gan eti yandondo-oma har sai mitso ga ya wyo labari etiu bo
So they both proceeded until when they were in the boat he scuttled it Said Moses Hast thou scuttled it in order to drown those in it Truly a strange thing hast thou done!,Acia ezan la fe lo har da kamina ada gandan eya-nuwanona ucia eya gu Musa ci gan wyoa eya gu ebo wyo la zanazhi fibo nao kyao fi nuwamo Hakika wyoa yandoci labe nama gbota na
He answered Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me,Ugan Asa mi gan wyo gan hakika wyoa jin hakuri wo be mi yina yina
 Moses said Rebuke me not for forgetting nor grieve me by raising difficulties in my caseMusa ci gan ,Ga le lefi mi ye eti yanna mia batan nama wyo mao ga la yandoci tami mini alamari mibo eti bayibao ma
Moses said Rebuke me not for forgetting nor grieve me by raising difficulties in my caseMusa ci gan ,Ga le lefi mi ye eti yanna mia batan nama wyo mao ga la yandoci tami mini alamari mibo eti bayibao ma
Then they proceeded until when they met a young man he slew him Moses said Hast thou slain an innocent person who had slain none Truly a foul unheard of thing hast thou done!,Acia ezan la fe lo har aci da tsun egi ndoci uciu wu Musa cigan Wyoa rayi lilici wu uma wu rayi ndoci wua Hakika wyoa etun na gyea na lo
He answered Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me,Ugan Asa mi gan ya wyo gan wyoajin hakuri wo be mi yina yina
Moses said If ever I ask thee about anything after this keep me not in thy company then wouldst thou have received full excuse from my side,Musa ci gan Mi ga kaara ci gbin wyo gan eti yandocio baaci wuncino be to ga la mi dan zano be ma hakika wyode uzuri yan baeni eti mibo
Then they proceeded until when they came to the inhabitants of a town they asked them for food but they refused them hospitality They found there a wall on the point of falling down but he set it up straight Moses said If thou hadst wished surely thou couldst have exacted some recompense for it!,Acia ezan la fe lo har aci tun eba jamaa yan alkarya ndocizhi aci wa bea yin gan a yaa yangicia gi aci navo naa -- a ega na Aci tsun kara ndoci wuna tsoba na wuna gbin na wyin Haliru ciu kuta gikini Musa ci gan wuna ba wyo ba da wyo gaa ewo etuno gwo
He answered This is the parting between me and thee now will I tell thee the interpretation of those things over which thou wast unable to hold patience,Ugan Nana gayi eka yan gingan tsakani mibo be wyo yino Mimaa ya wyo laabari yan nazhi wyo jin hakuri wo etia boa na
 As for the boat it belonged to certain men in dire want they plied on the water I but wished to render it unserviceable for there was after them a certain king who seized on every boat by force,Ammaa wyo le eya nuwan tso ye eza gwa gbagi guba ndocizhi ga wuno Atso mae lo tun dan eduo gancin micia kpa gan minla aibi ndocinlan danu ebo na yegboroabo ade etsu ndoci nae -- a eya wangi ndondo ke kpakae na
 As for the youth his parents were people of Faith and we feared that he would grieve them by obstinate rebellion and ingratitude to Allah and man,Amaa wyin egi dzakangi tso yanmanciUzhi gubaba muminizhi ayio Yici fe de dansun kede wyuna be laa da gbin iyaka Soko tu ganni be jin kafirinci-y Ebo cincin yan iyaaka naade yau na
So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange a son better in purity of conduct and closer in affection,Yi ma ci kpagan Tsocia Wuna sangwa yaa be egi natso de alheri gan wuncin eba edzutao be yeguny-na
As for the wall it belonged to two youths orphans in the Town there was beneath it a buried treasure to which they were entitled their father had been a righteous man So thy Lord desired that they should attain their age of full strength and get out their treasure - a mercy and favour from thy Lord I did it not of my own accord Such is the interpretation of those things over which thou wast unable to hold patience,Amaa yan kara tso egidzakangi guba ndocizhi yi ekun gizhi dan zhi ninbo na aga wuno Arziki-ko ndoci madan takoubo nayi yana na yanmancia ma wyunfe za guru Tsoci wyoe cia kpa gan a laa jin baligi amaa laa wancina tinaya gancin acia la dukiyaa wuncin tinaya wuncin mayi yegun dagan eba Tsoci wyoboMijin acin jin eti etun yangban mi boa Wuncin gayi laabaari yan na wyo jin hakuri wo etiu boa nao
 They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain Say I will rehearse to you something of his story,Amae gbin wyo gan eti labari Zulqarnainio gan yaa ganBele yin mia yae labari etiu bo
Verily We established his power on earth and We gave him the ways and the means to all endsHakika Yiga yan kagbo ta eti kinbo Yi ma ci jin ekpa yan na ugaa tso guri ndondo naSurah  One such way he followedU ma cia emitu ekpa wuncin,
Until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it set in a spring of murky water Near it he found a People We said O Zul-qarnain! thou hast authority either to punish them or to treat them with kindness,Har sai na utun emi loba yan igidi na uci da tsun wyune lo lo dan eye nuwan ndoci nayi ke edo-edo na uma ci tsun zandocizhi fi bagao Yici ganYa wyoe Zuiqarnaini immaa wuna ba wyoe wyo-ojina azaba zhi bagao ko ma wuna ba wyoe wyo-o-- egan natso gye gan na beuyin ugayi kalma ya shahadao
He said Whoever doth wrong him shall we punish then shall he be sent back to his Lord and He will punish him with a punishment unheard-of before,Zulqarnaini ci gan Amaade zana ga jin ti tacinu zwalunci be jin jin kafirinci nato Yia jinu azaba gancin ucin kezheu zhebanulo eba Tsociu Wyuntso cia jinu azaba azaba nayi dede na
But whoever believes and works righteousness- he shall have a goodly reward and easy will be his task as We order it by our Command,Amaa za na ga imani jin na uci lotun wangi na to egagba wangi gaajin tabbata yau Yimaa gangan be bere didaci-y beu yin eti alamari yi boSurah Then followed he another wayGancin ucia emi tu kpa gboro
 Until when he came to the rising of the sun he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no covering protection against the sun,Har na utun edzunba yan igidi na uda tsunu wune lala tinya ta eti jamaa ndoci zhio nama Yijin yekan ndondo yaa beuyina na
 He left them as they were We completely understood what was before him,Acinga ga ujin hukunci tsakaniabo waato iri kendoe ujin be za mafari zhi na Hakika ma Yi yia makezhe be kpikpe yannazhi udan-y ninbo naSurah Then followed he another wayGancin ucia mi tu kpa gboro
Until when he reached a tract between two mountains he found beneath them a people who scarcely understood a word,Har da kamina u tun ezhi ndoci nadan tsakani takun wanciko gubao na uci tsun jamaa ndocizhi zhi zunma pati wuncinzhio nazhi ma dakyar ejin fahimta egano na
They said O Zul-qarnain! the Gog and Magog People do great mischief on earth shall we then render thee tribute in order that thou mightest erect a barrier between us and them,Aci gan ya wyoe Zulqarnaini! Hakika Yajuju to Majuju zawangizhi ayio nazhie jin barna fi kinbo na ko wyoa jin yeda yiila laadae ya wyoe ebo wyo la yekan ndoci-odan tsakani yibo bea yin
 He said The power in which my Lord has established me is better than tribute Help me therefore with strength and labour I will erect a strong barrier between you and them,U ci ganYanna Tsoci mi jin ya mi na ugan laada na ye gan yea la ya mi na Yede jin mi taimako be kagbo nakan kpace ye yin mi ma ga yekan laadan tsakani yebo bea yin
 Bring me blocks of iron At length when he had filled up the space between the two steep mountain-sides He said Blow with your bellows Then when he had made it red as fire he said Bring me that I may pour over it molten lead,E be ya mi be yankpa rukugizhi har sai u gaajin daida dan tsakani pati gubaabao uci ganE fe be fiu fui har sai na wuna ke na na uci ganE be ya mi be dalmae yankpa zunzunciebo nla-n zhen kpeu etio
Thus were they made powerless to scale it or to dig through it,Ebo acino ade kagbo na aa gunU naa amade kagbo naa guu naa
He said This is a mercy from my Lord But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass He will make it into dust and the promise of my Lord is true,Uci gan Nana yegun uyio dagan eba Tsoci mi bo Kamina ma alkawali Tsoci mi ga dabe na ugayi ekina Alkiyamio Soko gau -- ruku-rukui alakwali Tsoci mi ma wunafe yan-na yi gaskiya na
On that day We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another the trumpet will be blown and We shall collect them all together,Yici ga sashi zawangizhi ya fo wuncin aga zhe keba fi mini sashia zhio aci ga kafo be yan Alkiyami gancin yi ci gaakuyekan yan baeni
And We shall present Hell that day for Unbelievers to see all spread out-,Yicia la jahannama dzun fi kafirizhi fo wuncin atso cia leuye be eye gasgadaa yin
Unbelievers whose eyes had been under a veil from remembrance of Me and who had been unable even to hear,Agayi zanazhi eye azhia na pipa Mi lugwa nao acia fe zanazhie de kafa shi tukpa gaskiyaa nao
Do the Unbelievers think that they can take My servants as protectors besides Me Verily We have prepared Hell for the Unbelievers for their entertainment,Kashi zanazhiajin kafirinci na e kpaye kpa gan aga wuzhi Mi ndocizhi la Tsociazhi ke Mi lugwa a gwo gwa gwo yaa wo be yandocii Hakika Yi yia tattali yan jahannama jin na ugaafe ecinba ya kafirizhi na
Say Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deeds-,Gan yaa gan Ngba Min yaye labari zanazhi jin hasara gan yan etunazhi na
Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their works,Agayi zanazhia laada etun wangiazhia nyin-ya dan mini edunfe izhea bo nao alaali ma a ye kpaye kpa gan etun wangizhi a ye lo
They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord and the fact of their having to meet Him in the Hereafter vain will be their works nor shall We on the Day of Judgment give them any weight,Zawuncinzhi gayi zanazhia jin kafirinci be aya Tsocia zhi nao amaajin kafirinci be bake naake be U yin na ebo acino etunazhi kpaataa nyin-ya Yi maa la tsunwan ndondo yaa Efo Alkiyami yina
 That is their reward Hell because they rejected Faith and took My Signs and My Messengers by way of jest,Wuncin gayi egagbaao ena jahannama ebo kafirinci naajin na aci kezhea Tuci Mizhi to aya Mizhi la eyan mi la na
As to those who believe and work righteous deeds they have for their entertainment the Gardens of Paradise,Hakika zanazhia imani jin aci lo tun wangi-wangizhi na Aljanna yan Firdausi gaafe ecinba yaa
Wherein they shall dwell for aye no change will they wish for from them,Amaa fi bofi tutun-yin amaa wa gwasan ndoci beuyina
 Say If the ocean were ink wherewith to write out the words of my Lord sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the words of my Lord even if we added another ocean like it for its aid,Gan yaa gan Daaci gan edu izhe kpata gaafe tadawa na agaa ka egan yan Tsoci mi zhia zo na kada ma Yi ga kezhe la taimako edu woro iriu zhi be be
 Say I am but a man like yourselves but the inspiration has come to me that your Allah is one Allah whoever expects to meet his Lord let him work righteousness and in the worship of his Lord admit no one as partner,Gan yaa ganHakika mide zawangi mi yi dozhin ye yeo naajin wahayi be ya mina kede hakika Tsoci yan ye Tsoci nini kete Uyio na ebo acino zana gae wa bake wangi be Tsociuyin na to wyundau lo tun etun nayi wangi na Umau ga la zaeni ndondo a pa Soko baci eba bauta jino ma

 This is a recital of the Mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zakariya,Nana  ye tun uyio yan iri yegun yan Tsoci wyoe naUjin ya wuzhiu Zakariyau naS
Behold! he cried to his Lord in secret,Yan kamina u yi Tsociu ye u ci fe bau yan swiswoci na
Praying O my Lord! infirm indeed are my bones and the hair of my head doth glisten with grey but never am I unblest O my Lord in my prayer to Thee!,UganTsoci hakika tsukun nakan kpace mi mi zhia to gbogun eti mi kpata maa she be tinyin bokuny Tsoci mi ma jin eza tiabi eba jin jin aduwao be ba wyo yaa
 Now I fear what my relatives and colleagues will do after me but my wife is barren so give me an heir as from Thyself-,Hakika ma mide dansun ya dangi mizhi na aa be gigun etun adini nana zunma mi boa na Yinmi mi ma kezheafe mara na laa magi leana ebo acino twa-mirya be egi naayi taimako jin ci na dagan nko wyo bo
One that will truly represent me and represent the posterity of Jacob and make him O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!,Naa gi gun mi na umaa gigun za mi Yakubu zhi na Tsoci wyo mao la wyunofe egi na wyoa jin yeda be yin na
 His prayer was answered O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son His name shall be Yahya on none by that name have We conferred distinction before,A ci be ganu gan wyoe Zakariyau! Yie jin wyoe bushara be dide egi na sunna wyunayi Yahya na Yima laa la sunna nana ya zandoci shidzo lea
He said O my Lord! How shall I have a son when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age,Ugan Tsoci mi! ke wuna zhezhe mi ci de egi nao alaali ma yinmi maafe maara nao mitso ma dan-na miatun legen lege eba nunsabo bo
He said So it will be thy Lord saith ´that is easy for Me I did indeed create thee before when thou hadst been nothing!´,Malaika ci ganAcinga ga Tsoci wyo gano wuncin eyan finfanci uyi eba Mi bo ngan na Mi ca jin jin wyoe mafari na wyo fe yandondo shiboa
Zakariya said O my Lord! give me a Sign Thy Sign was the answer Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights although thou art not dumb,UganTsoci mi! A alama ndoci laashishi ya mi na mi gaa kpe ewande yinmi mi ye na Soko ci gan Alamau ga yi cinbo yan egan gan yan yinmi wyoe be zawangizhi har yan efo guta gboro
So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber He told them by signs to celebrate Allah´s praises in the morning and in the evening,Gancin Zakariyau cia dzunfi jamaa yanuzhi dagan masallacio uci tagwa la wua gan efe li Soko to laazhi to lozun
To his son came the command O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,Soko ci gan wyo Yahya! Agwa sun Litafi Attaura be kagboe Yimaa hukunci Annabi laa yau tun uyi dzakangi yi re
 And piety for all creatures as from Us and purity He was devout,Yimau laafe eza tosayi dagan nko Yibo U mayi za na yangbanu tadzu na umaafe zanae sundan Soko na
And kind to his parents and he was not overbearing or rebellious,Umae la mitu foro yanmanciuzhi gubaba umajin eza ti kagbocia umajin zanae le Soko ba naa
So Peace on him the day he was born the day that he dies and the day that he will be raised up to life again!,Aminci Soko mau laujin tabbatau ta etiubo efo na aa mau na to efona ugaajin ajali na to fo na a gaa naukin kabario be rayi na
Relate in the Book the story of Mary when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East,Wyo mao tun labari Maryamuo ye itafi nanao kaminau kpe la dagan eba jamaa yanuzhio na uci daa bandoci uci da shi kansanta eyi-laazhino Baitul-Makadisio
 She placed a screen to screen herself from them then We sent her our angel and he appeared before her as a man in all respects,Ucia yekan ndoci laadan tsakaniubo bea yin gancin Yici tun RUHI YI fiu ugayi malaika Jibriluo uci da dzun fiu be sura zawangi
She said I seek refuge from thee to Allah Most Gracious come not near if thou dost fear AllahU gan ,Hakika mie ba be Sokoe na yi Etsu yegun na wyunu tswami be wyo yin wyunayi za nae sundan Soko na wyo yio naSurah  He said Nay I am only a messenger from thy Lord to announce to thee the gift of a holy sonUgan mi tuci Tsoci wyoe tsa mi yio mi be be eryatwa egi nayi lilici nae
 She said How shall I have a son seeing that no man has touched me and I am not unchaste,Ugan ke wuna zhezhe mici de gi nao alaali ma bagi ndondo laa la gwa to mi lea naa yino Mima kezhe jin yancin da cia
 He said So it will be Thy Lord saith ´that is easy for Me and We wish to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us´It is a matter so decreed,Malaika ci gan Acinga ga Tsoci wyo gano wuncin yanna fan na uyi eba Mi bo Mi man la wunnlanfe egwa wu yan zankpe ya zawangizhi umayi yegun dagan eba Yibo jinjin wuncin ma alaamari uyio naajin tabbataa ni na
 So she conceived him and she retired with him to a remote place,Ucia ewanu la uciu la kpe ya daa danna ndoci na lokpa na
And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree She cried in her anguish Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!,Etan yan naakuda ciu la daa kpetso cigban yan dobina nayi wiwoci na uci gan kasami re! E gan gan mia tsu kaafi alamari nanau be naa mi man lanzhe eyan tanbaci naa batanani naa
 But a voice cried to her from beneath the palm-tree Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee,Gancin uci Yiu dagan tako taubo cigan Ga nyin yangban ma hakika Tsoci wyoe wuna sangi-nuwan ndoci laadan kansanta wyo bo
 And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee,Wyo mao kun cigban yan dobina wuncinogwa sun-sun yan dobina fun-furuzhia fe cin be ya wyoe
 So eat and drink and cool thine eye And if thou dost see any man say ´I have vowed a fast to Allah Most Gracious and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being´,Gancin wyocio gi wyo mao fin wyo mao la hankali wyo-o cino ta zawangi ndondo nama wyoga le ye nato gan yau gan Mi la alkawali emi-wan be Sokoe ebo acino mia gan gan be zandondoe yin-naa
 At length she brought the babe to her people carrying him in her arms They said O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought!,Gancin ucia egi woro nau ma na la bea ya jamaa yanuzhi aci gan Ya wyoe Maryamu! Hakika wyo da be be yandoci na gbota na
O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil nor thy mother a woman unchaste!,Ya wyoe yegi yan Haruna! Hakika Babawyoe u fe zanaejin lalata naa ka Nna wyo ma ufe yancin-dacia
But she pointed to the babe They said How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradleUcia egwa ta wuu aci gan ,ke wuna zhezhe yi cia gan gan be egi bobongi na ma yi gun ede sakun yan mimano nao
He said I am indeed a servant of Allah He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet,Egi bobongi Isa ci gan Hakika mi wuzhi Soko mi yio wyuna Litafi laaya mi Uma mi laafe Annabi
And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live,Uma mi laafe eza albarka bandondo na mi ga dan na Uma jin mi gangba be tswitswa sallae be yiya yan zakkae abeke rayi ga dan be mi yin na
 He hath made me kind to my mother and not overbearing or miserable,Mi manlan fe zanae lamitu foro nna mi na uma la mi fe eti kagboci nae le Soko ba naa
 So peace is on me the day I was born the day that I die and the day that I shall be raised up to life again!,Aminci Soko mau laujin tabbatau ya mi fo na a mami na to fo na migaatsu na to fo na agaa nami kabario be rayii na
So peace is on me the day I was born the day that I die and the day that I shall be raised up to life again!,Aminci Soko mau laujin tabbatau ya mi fo na a mami na to fo na migaatsu na to fo na agaa nami kabario be rayii na
Such was Jesus the son of Mary it is a statement of truth about which they vainly dispute,Wuncin ga yi labari Isa egi Maryamuo egan yan gaskiya na ma etiubo ga zawangi zhie gbo-mi acie jin kelo-kezhino-na
 It is not befitting to the majesty of Allah that He should beget a son Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter He only says to it Be and it is,U -- yin ya Soko na wyuna degi naa lili kpataajin tabbata ya Soko ke aibi egi de lugwa U ma ga hukunci alamari ndondo ba Wyunajin Uganu ganafe u ci gaafe
Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord Him therefore serve ye this is a Way that is straight,Hakika ma Soko gayi Tsoci mi to yan ye yeo ebo acino ejin bauta yau nana ga yi ekpa natso yi gboro nao
 But the sects differ among themselves and woe to the unbelievers because of the coming Judgment of a Momentous Day,!Ena-ena nazhia kpa na cia cedozhi leba gan-cinma azaba yan zunyesun wunajin tabbata ya zanazhi ejin kafirinci be bibe yan efo na wancin nae
How plainly will they see and hear the Day that they will appear before Us! but the unjust today are in error manifest,!Wyo ajin mamaki eganwoazhi be eba cinle azhi efo na agaabe tsun yi na amaade azwalumizhi fo wuncin agaafe dan mini egbin naatula nao
But warn them of the Day of Distress when the matter will be determined for behold they are negligent and they do not believe!,Wyo mao jina gangba yan efo ro-- nkpe ti lokacina aga egagba yan alkiyami gunmi na alaali ma kamina a dan izheo na aafe dan mini eye yao ama ya gaskiya be alamari Soko yina
It is We Who will inherit the earth and all beings thereon to Us will they all be returned,Hakika Yi gaa gi gun yan kin nanao to zanazhi kpe tiubo kpata nao ebo Yi ga ma aa kua zheban zhino
It is We Who will inherit the earth and all beings thereon to Us will they all be returned,Hakika Yi gaa gi gun yan kin nanao to zanazhi kpe tiubo kpata nao ebo Yi ga ma aa kua zheban zhino
 Also mention in the Book the story of Abraham He was a man of Truth a prophet,Wyo mao tun labari Ibrahimuo ye dan mini Litafi nanao hakika eza gaskiya uyio umayi Annabi Soko
 Behold he said to his father O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not and can profit thee nothing,Kaminaugan be babauyin gan Ya wyoe babami! Kii la wyocie jin bauta ya yannae wo gana umae leba yea nao uma kunke ya wyo-wo be yandondo yina yino

O my father! serve not Satan for Satan is a rebel against Allah Most Gracious,Ya wyoe babami! Gajin bauta ya shetan ma hakika shetan lefi jinci Soko u yio
 O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from Allah Most Gracious so that thou become to Satan a friend,Ya wyoe babami! Hakika mie sundan na azabaa tswan wyoe dagan eba Soko nayi etsu yegun nao wyo mao ga beafe eya shetan ma
The father replied Dost thou hate my gods O Abraham If thou forbear not I will indeed stone thee Now get away from me for a good long while!,Babau ci gan To gbani wyoe Ibrahima wyoe la nanvo lawu kuti mi zhi be ke na Hakika kagan-okegan be wuncin yina hakika migao ce yan wyo mao kpeo-ya be mi yin minga leo ye be ma
Abraham said Peace be on thee I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness for He is to me Most GraciousUgan,Mia gan be wyo yin be amincii mi maa wa gafara ya wyoe be Tsoci mi yin hakika Etsu ryatwa uyi yami sarauyino
 And I will turn away from you all and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah I will call on my Lord perhaps by my prayer to my Lord I shall be not unblest,Mima gaa kpe ya be yeyin to yannazhi ye jin bauta ya baci Sokoona mi mae ba alheri be Tsoci mi yin hakika ma mi fe eza tiabi be jin-jin aduwae lo eba Tsoci mi yina
When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob and each one of them We made a prophet,Kaminau kpe ya bea yin to yanna afe jin bauta baci Sokoona Yici twaurya be Ishaqae to Yakubui zandondo miniabo ma Yiu laafe Annabi
 When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob and each one of them We made a prophet,Kaminau kpe ya bea yin to yanna afe jin bauta baci Sokoona Yici twaurya be Ishaqae to Yakubui zandondo miniabo ma Yiu laafe Annabi
And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them and We granted them lofty honour on the tongue of truth,Yima twaurya dagan mini yegunYi bo Yicia la fe eza yeji yan gaskiyazhi ganni be daraja na latu nae
 Also mention in the Book the story of Moses for he was specially chosen and he was a messenger and a prophet,Wyo mao tun Musao ye dan Litafi nanao Hakika eza tsitsaci uyio umayi Annabi be Tuciy
 And we called him from the right side of Mount Sinai and made him draw near to Us for mystic converse,Yi ma ci yiu dagan kansan gwaalo yan pati Turio Yiciu laatsoba ebo ezaba be Yi yinSurah  And out of Our Mercy We gave him his brother Aaron also a prophetYi ma twaurya dagan mini yegun Yibo be yegiu Harunae wyuntso ma Annabi uyio
 Also mention in the Book the story of Isma´il He was strictly true to what he promised and he was a messenger and a prophet,Wyo mao tun labari Ismaila-o ye dan mini Litafi nanao Hakika za nae she alkawali na uyio umayi Annabi be tuciy
 He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord,Umaafe za nae jin iyaaliuzhi foro be salla jiny-na to be yi-ya yan zakkae na umaafe eza yeda eba Tsociubo
Also mention in the Book the case of Idris He was a man of truth and sincerity and a prophet,Wyo mao tun labari Idrisuo ye dan mini litafi nanao Hakika wyunafe eza gaskiya umayi Annabi be
And We raised him to a lofty station,Yicia alamariu latu ta eti daraja nayi elatuci na
Those were some of the prophets on whom Allah did bestow His Grace- of the posterity of Adam and of those who We carried in the Ark with Noah and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose Whenever the Signs of Allah Most Gracious were rehearsed to them they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears,Zawuncinzhi agayi zanazhi Soko la niimau zhi ya nao dagan mini Annabizhio mini zuriya Adamuzhio to zanazhi yi kufi eya nuwano ganni be Nuhu-I na to mini zuriya Ibrahimazhio to israila Annabi Yaakubu to mini zanazhi Yi wuba na Yicia lafe eza tsitsacizhi na Kandondo na agae gba aya Soko yaana ajin a dakpya acia daa sujada acia fe tigi
 But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon then will they face Destruction-,Gancin zandocizhi ci be gwogwaa zunmaa bo zawuncinzhima aa salla ta yakpe acia mi tu eyan shahawa-shahawa yangbanazhi to bele-yin aa gun be azaba yan gayyui kpankoro uyio dede dan mini jahannamao
 Except those who repent and believe and work righteousness for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least-,Sai dai zana ga tuba jin ucia imani jin uci lotun wangi na to zawuncinzhi gaa gandan Aljannao amaa jina zwalunci ko degia
Gardens of Eternity those which Allah Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen for His promise must necessarily come to pass,Aljannazhi ayio yan danbo dan na Soko ajin wuzhiuzhi alkawali a mayi swiswoci na Hakika ma Alkawaliu yannaa dabe na uyio
They will not there hear any vain discourse but only salutations of Peace And they will have therein their sustenance morning and evening,Awo egan banza ndondo boa sai de emisa yan sallama dagan eba malaikazhio arzikiazhi ma fi baagao to laazhin to lozun
Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil,Aljanna wuncin na Yie giugun gi ya wuzhi Yizhi nazhiafe zanazhie sundan Soko na
 The angels say We descend not but by command of thy Lord to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us and what is between and thy Lord never doth forget-,Malaika Jibrilu ci gan Y I yie cin be kin yina sai dai be foro Tsoci wyo yin yannazhi dan yegboro yibo na to nazhi dan zunma yibo na to nazhi fi tacin wuncinzhio kpata na Soko wuno Tsoci wyo ma ufe Etsu naa bawu tan naa
Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them so worship Him and be constant and patient in His worship knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He,Wyun gayi Tsoci yan sanmazhi to kin to yannazhi fi tacinubo nao ebo acino fe jin bauta yaU wyo mao la hakurio jinodan bautaUbo Kashi wyo de kpikpendoci ke ade dozhinu na
 Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them so worship Him and be constant and patient in His worship knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He,Wyun gayi Tsoci yan sanmazhi to kin to yannazhi fi tacinubo nao ebo acino fe jin bauta yaU wyo mao la hakurio jinodan bautaUbo Kashi wyo de kpikpendoci ke ade dozhinu na
Man says What! When I am dead shall I then be raised up alive,Zawangi maajin ufe gan ganNgba migaatsu aa bea mi la tinya be be rayii
But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing,Ngba zawangi ma pa paa kede kamina Yi jin alittau shidzo batsozhio na ufe yandondoa yina
 But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing,Ngba zawangi ma pa paa kede kamina Yi jin alittau shidzo batsozhio na ufe yandondoa yina
 So by thy Lord without doubt We shall gather them together and also the Evil Ones with them then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell,To Mizhi kuti be Tsoci wyo yin sai Yi gaa la nakin kabario to shetanzhi baenio gancin Yi ciy daagway-zhi yegboro jahannamao zhikurao
Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against Allah Most Gracious,Gancin dagan mini jamaa ndondo Yi ga zanazhie gbotika sarauyin be Sokoe na wa zhizhi kaayin
 And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein,Gancin ma hakika Yiga de kpikpe gano yan iri zanazhi -- yin ena nanaa po nao
 Not one of you but will pass over it this is with thy Lord a Decree which must be accomplished,Amade zaeni ndondo minieboa saide ugaa kpandara sirati da -- gan Wuncin maafe hukunci naajin tabbataani dan eba Tsoci wyo bo na
But We shall save those who guarded against evil and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein humbled to their knees,Gancin Yiciga zanazhi sundan Soko na gangwa Yici ga azwalumizhi ya fibo zhi kurao
 When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them the Unbelievers say to those who believe Which of the two sides is best in point of position Which makes the best show in council,Ama gae gba aya Yizhi yaa gbangbae zanazhiajin kafirinci na aajin afe gan be zanazhia imani jin nae gan Ngba mini ena gubaabao kafirizhi be musulumizhi zii de kinigiba wanciko gano zii ma majalisau nkou gye-gano
But how many countless generations before them have we destroyed who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye,Dokun ma mini alumma nazhi shi-dzo na Yia jin hallaka Amade eyan izhe zhi gan ama gye gan eba cin-cin leo
 Say If any men go astray Allah Most Gracious extends the rope to them until when they see the warning of Allah being fulfilled - either in punishment or in the approach of the Hour- they will at length realise who is worst in position and who weakest in forces!,Gangan Zaeni ndondo na gaafe dan mini egbino na ngan Soko Etsu yegun wyuna to gban yau sarauyin Har da kamina a ga bea yanna e laajina alkawali na le ye ko azaba yan izhe ko ma yan Alkiyami To beleyin aakpe zii de kinigiba dede gano zii ma to gbogun gan eba taimako jincizhi bo
 And Allah doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance and the things that endure Good Deeds are best in the sight of thy Lord as rewards and best in respect of their eventual return,Soko maajin ube bawu ya zanazhi gamitu eko bawu na Etun wangi nazhia danabo dan na ade alheri gan eba Tsoci wyo bo eba laadao uma de alheri gan eba zoba wangio
Hast thou then seen the sort of man who rejects Our Signs yet says I shall certainly be given wealth and children,Ngba wyo le zana jin kafirinci be aya Yizhi na yea uci ganHakika aya mi dukiya be zuriyae naa
Has he penetrated to the Unseen or has he taken a contract with Allah Most Gracious,Beke ule gaibu eyan swiswoci ye le na kashi ude alkali ndoci de dagan eba Soko
 Nay! We shall record what he says and We shall add and add to his punishment,Ujinacina hakika Yiga yannazhi wyune gan na ka Yima ga yantaci azaba tatau yan baeni
To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone,Yima ga yanna wyune gan na gi-gun yau ucia be tsun yi wyuntso gbuugi
And they have taken for worship gods other than Allah to give them power and glory!,Acie da jin bauta ya kutizhi ndocizhi ke Soko lugwa eboadebaa laazhe kagboa yaa
Instead they shall reject their worship and become adversaries against them,Aa ujin acina bele-yin atso ga kafirinci jin be bauta nae jin yaa na atso maabea zhe makiriazhi be
Seest thou not that We have set the Evil Ones on against the unbelievers to incite them with fury,Kashi wyo kpe gan Yia jin Yitun shetanzhi fi kafirizhi acia jin afe fua shara dan mini egbin boa
 So make no haste against them for We but count out to them a limited number of days,Wyo de ga dinye yaa ma hakika Yie jin lisafi jinya yan adadi efo ajaliazhi
The day We shall gather the righteous to Allah Most Gracious like a band presented before a king for honours,Fo na Yigaa na zanazhie sundan Soko dagan kabaria zhio lo eba Soko na agaafe ega nazhi yi za cinwanci zhi na
 And We shall drive the sinners to Hell like thirsty cattle driven down to water-,Yicia nyan lefi jincizhi da fi ena jahannamao be egwadae
None shall have the power of intercession but such a one as has received permission or promise from Allah Most Gracious,Ade zandondo naade kagbo yan gwatan naa sai de zana gade izini dagan eba Soko Etsu naeye AL-RAHMANU nao
They say Allah Most Gracious has begotten a son!,Aci gan Soko AL-RAHMANU u yi be egi
 Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous!,Hakika yea eyan gbonta na man-y-woa na labe
At it the skies are ready to burst the earth to split asunder and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin,Sanmazhia tsoba na aga san na ebo egan dede na nao to kin yinotso wunejin ke ugaa banfi na to patizhi e jinke agaa nikin zhizhi acia laa ban ruku-ruku na
That they should invoke a son for Allah Most Gracious,Ebo egan dede yan ganmana naagan cigan Soko yi be egi na
 For it is not consonant with the majesty of Allah Most Gracious that He should beget a son,Uma -- yin -- ya Soko AL-RAHMANU na wyuna degi naa
 Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to Allah Most Gracious as a servant,Hakika zandondo na dan mini sanmazhio to kin bo na aa be eba Soko AL-RAHMANU be kinigiba yan wuzhio
He does take an account of them all and hath numbered them all exactly,Hakika Sokoa alittazhi kpaata tswa U maa jin lisafi so-san yin
 And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment,Kpaataa ma abe tsun Soko tsun efo Alkiyami nni-nni
 On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness will Allah Most Gracious bestow love,Hakika zanazhia imani jin aci lotun wangi-wangi zhi na Soko ga boye be cin-cin-y laadan tsakaniabo be dozhi
 So have We made the Qur´an easy in thine own tongue that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous and warnings to people given to contention,Hakika Yia Alkuranu laafe finfanci be gintara zhi-mi wyo yin ebo wyo la wuno jin busharao-ya zana zhie sundan Soko na wyo mao la wunojin gangbao ya zanazhie gbotika acie sun-wun be alamari Sokoe na Alumma zhi ma dokun nazhi Yi jina hallaka shidzo batsozhio na kashi wyo-wo san-san zaeni ndondo miniabo kashi wyo wo berea be
 But how many countless generations before them have We destroyed Canst thou find a single one of them now or hear so much as a whisper of themAnd how many have We destroyed before them of generations Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound,

This is the Book in it is guidance sure without doubt to those who fear Allah,Wuncin ga yi litafio kelo-kezhin ndondo dan mini uboa bawu uyio ya za nazhie wo soko dan mini yangban azhio amae sundanuna
Who believe in the Unseen are steadfast in prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them,Za nazhia gaskiya ya be yanazhi ankaliazhi maakezhe wao nana mae la salla ku gikini na a mae wu dukiya nazhi yi layaa arziki na fi eko guru zhio na
And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee and sent before thy time and in their hearts have the assurance of the Hereafter,To za nazhia gaskiya ya de yan na acin de ya wyoe na to na acin de shi-wyo dzo na ama hakika ya de efo zobae na
They are on true guidance from their Lord and it is these who will prosper,Za wuncinzhi ata etib eko gboro-na fe de dagan nko Tsocia bo na Za wuncin zhi ma a ga yi za nazhi atso gurinao
As to those who reject Faith it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them they will not believe,Hakika za nazhia cin manabo be sokoena yeni uyi ebaabo ka wyo ga jina gangba ko ma wyo ga jina ma a ga ya gaskiyaa
Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing and on their eyes is a veil great is the penalty they incur,Sokoa eyan te ba yangbanzhio to tupkaazhio yebo maarupkea eyeazhio azaba na ma gbota na gajin tabbata yaa
Of the people there are some who say We believe in Allah and the Last Day but they do not really believe,A ma de dan mini zawangizhio za na  ajin u da egan -gan gan  zobae na alali ma ajin muminizhia ganmana-e-zuno
Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe but they only deceive themselves and realise it not!,A cie le ye gan a ye ta soko to zanazhia imani jin na alali ma ujin zandondo e taa sai eti tacinatso ammaa atso santua
In their hearts is a disease and Allah has increased their disease And grievous is the penalty they incur because they are false to themselves,Batan ndoci fi mini yangbanazhio soko cike zhea batan ndoci laabea be gancin azaba na tan sarauyin nan ajin tabbata yaa ebo etun nazhi afe lo yan ganmanan na
When it is said to them Make not mischief on the earth they say Why we only Want to make peace!,Ama ga gan yaa gan Ega fe nyin-yanzhi kpe eti kinbo maa tsoajin agan Hakika yi za nazhie ta yanzhidzu cie jin gyaara na yi yio
Of a surety they are the ones who make mischief but they realise it not,A a akika a za wuncin zhi a gayi za nazhie nyi yan nao ammaade esantua
When it is said to them Believe as the others believe They say Shall we believe as the fools believe Nay of a surety they are the fools but they do not know,Gancin aga gan ya-agan yea imani jin kendoe ezazhi nayncinazhi jin imaninaAjin agan  yi-la imani-jin kendoewawazhi jin imaninaAa akika atso nnazhiy a ga yi wawazhio ammaa akpea
When they meet those who believe they say We believe but when they are alone with their evil ones they say We are really with you We were only jesting,Gancin ka mina aga bea bokeba be za nazhia imani jin nae ajin agan ganyi ya imani jin ka mina uga bea keatso dan eba shai-tan nayincinazhio na ajin agan Hkika be ye yin ga yi dano hakika yi delamila kawanyin
Allah will throw back their mockery on them and give them rope in their trespasses so they will wander like blind ones To and fro,Sokoa woa gbata dede be emi naala na umaa two gban yaa danmini ragbanshi bo har aciga na gboye
These are they who have bartered Guidance for error But their traffic is profitless and they have lost true direction,za wuncinzhia ga yi za nazhia egbin shi be bawuynao woce wun cin naace na udzun be ele yina atso maajin eza bawu zhia
Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire when it lighted all around him Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness So they could not see,Kotoncin yan za wuncinzhi uyi ke kotonchi za na ena gun-na kamina haske yan ena ala she yan nazhi mau gwoba kpata na soko cia haskeawuncin laake ya bo ucia ya fi bazhikozhio acie leba yea
Deaf dumb and blind they will not return to the path,Tukpatencizhi edingizhi yeboncizhi ebo acino azhin eko gboro bea
Or another similitude is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky In it are zones of darkness and thunder and lightning They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap the while they are in terror of death But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!,Ko ma kotonkoci-ayi ke girgije naashe be ele ucie du zhin daga sanmao na miniubo bazhi kozhi danbo to kara yan radi to sanmadzwan acie la egwa gingini-nazhi fi tukpaazhio ebo dansu yan tsutsuo akika sokoa yanna kafirizhi danyi ninbo na makezhe
The lightning all but snatches away their sight every time the light Helps them they walk therein and when the darkness grows on them they stand still And if Allah willed He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing for Allah hath power over all things,Sanmadzwan wuncin wun etsoba ke yan naa-- ba yeleazhi be ayin na kami ndondo na uga la haske fia na ajin afe dazan fi miniubo kamina-ma uga bea shi zhiko fia na a ajin agikini Dawunaba soko ba da uga gan- be ganwoazhiy to ba- yeleazhi Hakika soko de kagbo ta eti jin-jin yandondo
ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord who created you and those who came before you that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness,Ya ye zawangizhi ! Ejin bauta ya Tsoci-ye natso jin alita ye na to ye to zanazhi shi ye dzo na ko be wuncin ye gafe za nazhia tswa soko acia sundanu na
Who has made the earth your couch and the heavens your canopy and sent down rain from the heavens and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know the truth,Etsu na ta kin ci ci ya ye parae na uci ke zhea sanma kan gikini tutuci uci du elezhin dagan sanmao ucie wa yangici sun-sunzhi tinya be ele ebo ulau fe arzikiu yaye nao Eboacino egala yandochizhi afe tsudo ko yezun ya soko ma ye tso ma kpe ke ade dozhin sokoa na
And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant then produce a Sura like thereunto and call your witnesses or helpers If there are any besides Allah if your doubts are true,Uma ga fe gan ye jin shakkajin be yanna yi cin beyn ya wuzhi yi na to yetsoe be be ka wuna yi sura niniy naayi dozhiu na wunayi eza gaskiyazhi ga ye yio na
But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones- which is prepared for those who reject Faith,Kagan ye be jin woa to ye maajin woa har da zoba izhea e tobo wuncino e sundan azaba yan ena natso yanna aga gununa uga yi zawangizhi be takunzhi-yinonaAma jina tattali jin ya kafirizhi
But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness that their portion is Gardens beneath which rivers flow Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom they say Why this is what we were fed with before for they are given things in similitude and they have therein companions pure and holy and they abide therein for ever,wyo mao yalabari yan gban-fao-ya za nazhia imani jin acie lotun wangizhi na kede hakika ayibe emi aljannazhi nazhi nuwan zhie je fi tako abo naKandondo na a ga yayangicizhi dagan mini yangici sun sunzhi yan aljanna o na ajin a ganngan nana gaala ya yi ga leanio ebo bibe naabe dozhi eyeo nao a cia fe lau be yaaciafe yan nazhi bedozhi naGancin ade fi mini aljannazhio yinmi lilicizhi a tso ma ga afe fi mini ubo fife yan yan gbegben-na
Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things lowest as well as highest Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord but those who reject Faith say What means Allah by this similitude By it He causes many to stray and many He leads into the right path but He causes not to stray except those who forsake the path, Hakika soko wune sun zunyea na wuna la misali yan gaskiya wu ye naa ka wunayi be ke emagi yino ko be yandoci naganacin na Ammade za nazhia imani jin na ayi be kpikpe kede gaskiya u yio na fe be dagan eba Tsociabo na amma za nazhia cin manabo be Sokoe cia jin kafirinci na ajin afe gan gan kiy Sokoe kpa be misali na na-e beo wune la zazhi kun-dondo fi mini egbinu yin u mae gbin zazhi beuyina sai-de za nazhi yi fasikizhi na
Those who break Allah´s Covenant after it is ratified and who sunder what Allah Has ordered to be joined and do mischief on earth These cause loss only to themselves,Za nazhie lo alkawali soko ya na ba ci na uta kpankoro na amae la gingan be bibae dan yan na Soko jin foro gan a la wuna gun na a mae nyin yanzhi fi mini kinbo na za wunccinzhi a ga yi eza asara zhio
How can ye reject the faith in Allah- seeing that ye were without life and He gave you life then will He cause you to die and will again bring you to life and again to Him will ye return,Keu be yiyi ye cie cin manabo ye cie jin kafirinci be Sokoe nao alalima ye yafe eyan tsutsu cizhi bedzo gancin Sokocia ye dan rayi gancin ucia kezhe bea ye wu gancin ebau gaakuye zheban da tsuno
It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth Moreover His design comprehended the heavens for He gave order and perfection to the seven firmaments and of all things He hath perfect knowledge,Wyun gayi za najin alitta ya ye yan yan nazhi fi kinbo kpata nao gancin u cia jin daidai be yan nazhi ukpa na lo eba sama gancin jin daidai har sama gutwaba Wyun ma Etsu kpikpe u yio yan yandondo
Behold thy Lord said to the angels I will create a vicegerent on earth They said Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy name He said I know what ye know not,Wyo mao pa ka mi na Tsoci wyoe gan gan be malaikazhi gan hakika miga alifa za naagi kini ya alamari mizhi nan  laa shi kinbo AcinganWyoa la eza dando za naa nyinyan fi nin yanubo na umaa zhe egya zazhi ya na Alali ma yi ye li wyoe tsatsayin be yebo jin eyo yin yi maela edzuta zhi dan alamari wyozhio ya wyoe Uci gan Hakika mide kpikpe yan yanazhi ye de kpikpea na
And He taught Adam the names of all things then He placed them before the angels and said Tell me the names of these if ye are right,Ucia kpikpe laaya Adamu yan sunna eyanzhi kpaata gancin ucia yan-wuncin zhi laazhi yegboro malaikazhio kpaata ucin ganE ya mi labari yan sunna yan nanazhiy wunayi eza gaskiyazhi ye yio na
They said Glory to Thee of knowledge We have none save what Thou Hast taught us In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom,A ci gan lili kpata ajin tabbata ya wyoe Soko Hakika yi de kpikpe ndondoa sai dai natso wyo ga la cia wu yi na hakika wyoe ga yi Etsu kpikpeo be Estu yan hikima yano
He said O Adam! Tell them their names When he had told them Allah said Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal,U ci gan  ya wyoe Adamu! A sunna yan-nnazhi ta ya kamina uta sunna yaazo na u ci gan asa mi gan ya ye gan Hakika mi yi be kpikpe yan yannazhi so fi mini samazhio to kin bo naa Mi ma yi be kpipke yan yannazhi ye jin tula kpata na to nazhi yejin swisoci naa
And behold We said to the angels Bow down to Adam and they bowed down Not so Iblis he refused and was haughty He was of those who reject Faith,wyo mao pa lokaci na yi gan be malaikazhi gan E jin sujada yan cinwan ya Adamu na gancin kpata aci da sujada sai dai ibilisu U navo u maa gbotika ucia fe dan mini kafirizhio
We said O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat of the bountiful things therein as where and when ye will but approach not this tree or ye run into harm and transgression,Yi ci gan ya wyoe Adamu! A fedun to wyoe to nyimi wyoe fi mini Aljannao ye mae gi yan gicizhi dagan mini ubo be bagwoe bandondo na ye gae wa mini ubo na ammaa ega tsoba cigban nana ma kacina yega fe dan mini azwalumizhio
Then did Satan make them slip from the garden and get them out of the state of felicity in which they had been We said Get ye down all ye people with enmity between yourselves On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time,Shaitan cia ta ke emi Aljanna lugwa u cia wadzun tinya ke emi niima naadan nin yanubo na lugwa Yi ci gan E cin lo kin sashi yezhi aga zhe makirizhi eza nanvozhi ya sa shizhi ye maade adunfeba kinbo be emawoe harda lokaci ndoci
Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration and his Lord Turned towards him for He is Oft-Returning Most Merciful,Ganci Adamu ci gwo egan ndocizhi dagan eba Tsoci u bo yan tuba jin soko maatuba nau jin nagwo Akika soko wyun ga yi Etsu nae gwo tuba nao wyun ga mayi Etsu yeguno
We said Get ye down all from here and if as is sure there comes to you Guidance from me whosoever follows My guidance on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Yi ci gan ecin lokin baenio Ammaujin-wo bawu ndocia fe be yaye dagan nko yan mi bo zandondo na ga mitu bawu yan mi na eyan dasun ndondo a da etiu gwo gana amaale yangban nyin yea
But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs they shall be companions of the Fire they shall abide therein,Za nazhi ma ajin kafirici a cia aya yiyi ganmana na za wuncinzhi agayi egi emina zhio a maafi bofi tutun yin
O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which I bestowed upon you and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with you and fear none but Me,Ya ye Banu Israilaazhi e fa pa niima Mi na mi laya ye yan emawo na ye mae la alkawali mizhi eshe Mi tso ga alkawali yezhi she ye mae lae fe za nazhie sundan mi na
And believe in what I reveal confirming the revelation which is with you and be not the first to reject Faith therein nor sell My Signs for a small price and fear Me and Me alone,Ye mae la imani e jin be yan na mi cin be ya ye na e la gaskiya dan natso dan be ye yin na ye mae gaafe kakanca yan za nazhiajin kafirinci beu yin na ma Ye mae ga la aya mizhi da shi ewodegi yan izhe ma Ye mae sundan Mi gbaugi
And cover not Truth with falsehood nor conceal the Truth when ye know what it is,Ye ga la gaskiya a bo keba be ganmae ma ye cie lagaskiya swo yetso ma kpe ke wuncin gyea na
And be steadfast in prayer practise regular charity and bow down your heads with those who bow down in worship,Ye mae la sallae kuegikini ye mae la zakka dukiya yezhie wa ye mae fe jin ruku ganni be za na zhie jin rukuu nae
Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people and forget To practise it yourselves and yet ye study the Scripture Will ye not understand,Ngba ye yea fe jin zawangizhi umurni be lwilwo yan etun alheriy yetso mae la eti tacin yetso batan yetso mae gba litafi elwo be zhiny kashi ye de ankali dea
Nay seek Allah´s help with patient perseverance and prayer It is indeed hard except to those who bring a lowly spirit,Ye mae fe wa taimako soko be jin jin hankuriy be salla jiny Akika ma eyan uyio na wancin uma lukpin na sai-dai ya za nazhi gae sundan soko na wyune lazhe eyan finfan ci
Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord and that they are to return to Him,za nazhi a akika ladan kede a ya be gun be Tsociaa yin nae be akikae ma ebau ga a yaa zheban lo na
Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to all other for My Message,Ya ye Banu Israilazhi! Efe pa niima Mizhi nazhi mi la ya ye yan emawozhi na kema be akikae mia ye ya falala daraja ta eti alittazhio na
Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail another nor shall intercession be accepted for her nor shall compensation be taken from her nor shall anyone be helped from outside,Ye mae sundan yan efo nini kete ndoci fo wuncin rayi ndondo wuna gwogwa wo ya rayi ndoci be yandoci yina amaagwo gwatan egwa rayi ndondo boa amaagwo sisa yan rayi be yandoci yina zandondo ma danbo a jina taimakoa
And remember We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh They set you hard tasks and punishments slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord,yamae fe pa lokaci na yi gwo yetswa dagan egwa jemaa yan firawnazhio na kanga afe jin ye azaba dedezhi afe wan egi bagi yezhi zun acie la egi yinzagiezhi lugwa be rayia yin Mini wuncino mimacinle danbo dagan eba Tsoci ye bo mimacinle na gbota na
And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh´s people within your very sight,Ye mae pa lokaci na yi yaa edu lafi ebo yebo na yi cia ye gwotswa yicia jamaa yan firawnazhi gbinfi eduo kanga ma ye tso fe cinale
And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses and in his absence ye took the calf for worship and ye did grievous wrong,Ye mae fe pa lokaci na yi la alkawali yan yeshi shiba be Musa ena gancin ye ci da nanko la fewun zumanu bo ye cia fe azwalumizhi
Even then We did forgive you there was a chance for you to be grateful,Gan ci yi ci fa be ye yin zuma wuncino watakila be wunciny yeajin yebo ya soko
Even then We did forgive you there was a chance for you to be grateful,Gan ci yi ci fa be ye yin zuma wuncino watakila be wunciny yeajin yebo ya soko
And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion Between right and wrong There was a chance for you to be guided aright,Ye mae fe pa lokaci na yi la litafi to egan yekpazhi ya Musa na ebo ujin-wo be wunciny ye lae ke eko gboro
And remember Moses said to his people O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf So turn in repentance to your Maker and slay yourselves the wrong-doers that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker Then He turned towards you in forgiveness For He is Oft-Returning Most Merciful,Lokaci na musa gan-gan be jamaa yanuzhi na ugan yaye jamaa yan mizhi!

And remember ye said O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even as ye looked on,To lokaci na ye gan gan Ya wyoe musa!Yi ga jin imani ebo eganwyo boa sai yi ga Soko otso leye yele yan gbangba gancin eduku yan sanma cia wangi yetso ma fecinbale
Then We raised you up after your death Ye had the chance to be grateful,Gancin yi cia ye lanakin baci na yea tsu na watakila be wunciny yea jin yebo ya Soko
And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails saying Eat of the good things We have provided for you But they rebelled to us they did no harm but they harmed their own souls,Yi cia girgijie la akan wuru ta eti yebo Yi ma yangici yan manna managi uyio ke efu nabe soya nakan yan lukukuzhicin bea yayeEgi manamanazhi mini yangici wangi nazhi Yi laayaye arziki nao Etun dede ndondomauga gba arziki soko zuma ma Ajin yi gun wao ammaade eti tacina tsa ajin guno

And remember We said Enter this town and eat of the plenty therein as ye wish but enter the gate with humility in posture and in words and We shall forgive you your faults and increase the portion of those who do good,To lokaci na yi ganE gandan alkarya nanao gancin ye mae gi mini ubo mae ganedan eko bae na ganni be bagwoe Ye mae gan gan fa be yi yin Yia fa be bicicin yezhiyi ma abe bolo boloya za nazhielo tun wangizhi na

But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven for that they infringed Our command repeatedly,Za nazhi jin zwalunci na cia egwasan ladan egano ke naagan yana lugwa Ebo acino Yi ci cin azaba be yadagan samao ebo etun fasikanci nazhi elona
And remember Moses prayed for water for his people We said Strike the rock with thy staff Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs Each group knew its own place for water So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah and do no evil nor mischief on the face of the earth,To ka-minan Musa fe ba nuwan finfinci jamaa yanuzhina Yi gan A tsukun wyoelaazhe takun Eyenuwanzhi har guwo be-gubae cia la tinya akika zandondo kpe nuwan finbau Ye E gi emae fin dagan mini arziki soko ye mae ga nyiny anzhi fimini kinbo ma
And remember ye said O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food always so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth -its pot-herbs and cucumbers Its garlic lentils and onions He said Will ye exchange the better for the worse Go ye down to any town and ye shall find what ye want! They were covered with humiliation and misery they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause This because they rebelled and went on transgressing,To lokacina ye gan gan Ya wyoe Musa!

Those who believe in the Qur´an and those who follow the Jewish scriptures and the Christians and the Sabians- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day and work righteousness shall have their reward with their Lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Akika za nazhia imani jin nabe yahudizhi be nasarazhi be sabiuzhiy nazhie jin bawta ya malaikazhi na nazhiy ga tuba jin acia imani jin be Sokoe be efozobae naacike lo tun wangizhi na ayibe egagba ayin dan eba Tsociabo Eyan dansun ndondomaado etia -- gana amale yangban nyin ndodonyea
And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you The towering height of Mount Sinai  Saying Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring ever to remembrance what is therein Perchance ye may fear Allah,To kamina yila alkawali beye yin na yi cia pati latu ke eti yezhi lugwa yea egwa sun yan na yi la yaye na be kagboe Ye mae fepa yan nazhi ga fi bo na ujin wo be wunciny ye ga fe za nazhie tswa Soko na
But ye turned back thereafter Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah to you ye had surely been among the lost,Gancin ye cia zuma zheta baci yanwuncino kaujin ebo falala Soko be yegunu yin na ta eti yebo naa daa ye ga fe dan mini eza asara zhio
And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath We said to them Be ye apes despised and rejected,Be ma akika yetso kpe za nazh -- iyaka gan mini yeboeti efo asibio na Yi ma cia gana gan Yea zhe ebegizhia gba na
So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity and a lesson to those who fear Allah,Yi cia wuncin laafe azaba ewun na ebo yan na shidzo dan yegboro na to natso dan zumaubo na umau lauzhe gangba ya za nazhi gae sundan Soko na
And remember Moses said to his people Allah commands that ye sacrifice a heifer They said Makest thou a laughing-stock of us He said Allah save me from being an ignorant fool!To lokaci na Musa gan be jamaa yanuzhi na ,Akika Soko jin ye foro gan yele nan-- ezunAci ganKashi wyoe la yi la migaafe dan mini jahilizhio na
They said Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what heifer it is! He said He says The heifer should be neither too old nor too young but of middling age Now do what ye are commanded!,Aci gan Ba ya yi be tsoci wyo yin ujin bayaniu yayi kiy nanko wuncin yi o Ugan Akika wyune gan ganAkika nanko ude yi tatacin wuncizhi ebo acino yea etun lo be foro naajin ye na
They said Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour He said He says A fawn-coloured heifer pure and rich in tone the admiration of beholders!,Aci gan Ba ya yi be Tsoci wyo yin ujin bayaniu yayi ke kalau yiyi nao U gan Akika wyune gan ganAkika nanko uyio kalauyi wanjin wanjin na li u mae ban na sarauyin na wyine fa za zazhi gae cinule na yangban
They said Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is To us are all heifers alike We wish indeed for guidance if Allah wills,Aci ganBa ya yi be Tsoci wyo yin ujin bayaniu ya yi kiy nanko wuncin yin ebona akika nankozhi abedozhi fi yi Yi Akika ma yi ugaaba Soko eza yi yio nazhi ga mi tu bawu na
He said He says A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields sound and without blemish They said Now hast thou brought the truth Then they offered her in sacrifice but not with good-will,U ci gan Akika wyune gaganAkika nanko tsa uyio ujin naajin foro cie nunu kinbo naaumae ya yangici latizhi nuwan fina uyi be lafiyae wangiu de etinzhi fi nakan boa Aci gan Gbani wyoa gaskiya laa wuyi Aci u zun ke yan na baa yin jina na
Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide,Ye mae fe pa lokaci na ye wu ye wu rayi na ye ci fe la lefi tu dozhi dan miniubo akika ma Soko ga yan na yeswo na la tu
So We said Strike the body with a piece of the heifer Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs Perchance ye may understand,Gancin yi ci gan E danu yan be sashiu yin yan nanko naa zun na  Acinga ga Sokoe la rayi dan eyan tsutsu cio umae la zankpeu zhi wu ye ujinwo be wunciny ye gaazhe eza ankalizhi
Thenceforth were your hearts hardened They became like a rock and even worse in hardness For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth others there are which when split asunder send forth water and others which sink for fear of Allah And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do,Gancin yangban yezhi cia wo kpakpara yin zuma yan wuncio U cia zhe ke takuna na koma uke wo kpakparae gan takun Ebo na koma akika mini takuzhio ade na nuwan eduzhie tinya miniubo na  Akika ade dan miniubo naajin ucin be ya ebo dansun yan Soko na Soko ma fe eye-yacia ke etun nazhi yelo na lugwaa
Can ye o ye men of Faith entertain the hope that they will believe in you- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah and perverted it knowingly after they understood it,Kashi yeede fan-fan de gan aga imani jin ebo yebo alali ma wunafe gan sashi miniabo afe shitukpa wo egan Soko gancin aci gau zhegba baci na wuna yea na alaliy ma atso yi be kpikpe
Behold! when they meet the men of Faith they say We believe But when they meet each other in private they say Shall you tell them what Allah hath revealed to you that they may engage you in argument about it before your Lord- Do ye not understand their aim,Kamina aga dazan gun za nazhia imani jin na agan Yia imani jin kamina ma uga bea ke sashi atso tson-yin be sashia yin na a gan Ye gangan gan beayi eti eko kpe yan aziki na Soko kpe yaye na ebo adebaala wuncina fe hujja eti yebo eba Tsoci ye boKashi ye de ankali dea
Know they not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal,Akpe gan soko kpe ena so nan be ena tula nan ya
And there are among them illiterates who know not the Book but see therein their own desires and they do nothing but conjecture,Miniabo ma ade umiyyuzhi zanazhi ma katun gbaa ama makana a de kpikpeyan litafia sai dai egan ecizhi ama de yandondo kpe tsoa sai dai yekpa yan etiazhi
Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then sayThis is from Allah to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write and for the gain they make thereby,Azaba yan zunyesun wunajin tabbata ya za nazhie ka litafi be egwaazhiy na gancin acia jin afe dagan-gba gba Nana dagan eba Soko bo u fe beo ade baala wuncina laashi ewo izhe na gan aciaana Azaba yan zunyesun wun ajin tabbata etiabo be iri yannazhi egwaazhi ka na azaba yan zunyesun wunajin tabbata ta etiabo be woce dede nae ce na
And they say The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days Say Have ye taken a promise from Allah for He never breaks His promise or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know,Ama ke gan gan Enaapo yiyia saide yan efo nazhi yi bibacizhi na Gan gan be ke ye la alkawali ndoci la eba Soko na natso ma yetuye gan Sokoa leu bana kashi yede wan ganezhi wan gan eti Soko yan yanazhi yede kpikpa wuna na
And they say The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days Say Have ye taken a promise from Allah for He never breaks His promise or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know,Ama ke gan gan Enaapo yiyia saide yan efo nazhi yi bibacizhi na Gan gan be ke ye la alkawali ndoci la eba Soko na natso ma yetuye gan Sokoa leu bana kashi yede wan ganezhi wan gan eti Soko yan yanazhi yede kpikpa wuna na
Nay those who seek gain in evil and are girt round by their sins- they are companions of the Fire Therein shall they abide For ever,Acin gao zandondo na ga da cewo dede na har ma lefiu cia mau gwoba na akika za wuncinzhi gayi egimi nazhio a maafi nin yan ubo fi gbegben na
But those who have faith and work righteousness they are companions of the Garden Therein shall they abide For ever,Za nazhiy maa imani jin na acie lotunwangizhi na za wuncinzhi gayi egimi Aljannazhio amaafi bo fi tuntunyin
And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel to this effect Worship none but Allah treat with kindness your parents and kindred and orphans and those in need speak fair to the people be steadfast in prayer and practise regular charity Then did ye turn back except a few among you and ye backslide even now,lokaci na la alkawali ya Banu Israilazhi na ega jin bawta ya yan ndondo ma sai Soko ye mea fe jin bolobolo ya yanmanci gubaba to dangi yan tsonbazhi  Ye maefe gan-gan wangi be zazhiy ye mea la swallae kue gikini ye mea la zakka dukiya yezhie wagancin bo ye cia pan ya ke eko guru lugwa
And remember We took your covenant to this effect Shed no blood amongst you nor turn out your own people from your homes and this ye solemnly ratified and to this ye can bear witness,Ye fe pa kamina yi la alkawali be ye yin na ye yea zhe egya dozhi yaa yemaa yan dozhi tinya dagan emiezhi boa Gancin yecia alkawali gboka yetso cia fe erizhi eti wuncino
After this it is ye the same people who slay among yourselves and banish a party of you from their homes assist Their enemies against them in guilt and rancour and if they come to you as captives ye ransom them though it was not lawful for you to banish them Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in and do ye reject the rest but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty For Allah is not unmindful of what ye do,Gancin yetso dan na ye zhe egya dozhi ya ye mae la sashi yezhi yan tinya daga emiazhio yacie jin dozhi taimako etiabo be jin jin lefiy be binakuny za nazhi yi za win-wacizhi na a ga be eba yae yegwo sisa egwaabo be yandociy alalima aramu uyio yaye na yea yana tinya na kashi ye gaa imani jin be sashi yan na litafi gan na yeci gaajin kafirinci be sashiy Ngba ki yi egagba yan za na gae jin acin mini yebo nao saide egba be zunyesuny dan mini edunfe izheo gancin efo alkiyamiy agaaku daafi azaba na tan gan nao Akika ma soko yayea ke yan nazhi yejin na lugwaa
These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped,za wuncizhi agayio za nazhia emawo edunfe izhe shi be edunfe yan alkiyamiy nao ebo acino sokoajin sauki yan azaba yaaa amaade zando jina taimakoa
We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear Signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not ye are puffed up with pride- Some ye called impostors and others ye slay!,Akika ma yi la litafi a ya Musa yi cia Tucizhi gbau zunmao be yi cia bayani be hujjazhiy laaya Isa egi Maryamu yi ci u ya kagbo be Rayililiciy ugayi Jibrilu oNgba kamindondo na tuci ga be ya ye be yanna ba yangbanye yea na yea gbotika bea yin yecia kansan ndoci yi ganmana kansan ndoci ma ye laa wu
They say Our hearts are the wrappings which preserve Allah´s Word we need no more Nay Allah´s curse is on them for their blasphemy Little is it they believe,A ci gan yangban yi zhia tsu Aa soko dea bomi ebo kafirinci naejin na za degi miniabo gae jin imani o
And when there comes to them a Book from Allah confirming what is with them- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith- when there comes to them that which they should have recognised they refuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is on those without Faith,Kamina litafi be yaa dagan eba soko na natso mae wu gaskiya yan yannazhi fi gwaabo na amaafe kanga afe wa taimako ta eti yan kafirizhio Kamina yanna akpeye cie wa na be dabe yaa na ajin kafirinci beu yin ebo acino emibo yan soko cia jin tabbata ta eti kafirizhio
Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls in that they deny the revelation which Allah has sent down in insolent envy that Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith,Tir jam be yan na ada la rayizhi shi na na har ajin kafirinci be yanna soko cin beyn na ebo yangban dedeo naejin be falala soko naucin yanu be ya za na ga bau mini wuzhiu zhio na Acia zheban be fushi eti fushio Akika azaba yan zunyesun ajin tabbata ya kafirizhi
When it is said to them Believe in what Allah Hath sent down they say We believe in what was sent down to us yet they reject all besides even if it be Truth confirming what is with them Say Why then have ye slain the prophets of Allah in times gone by if ye did indeed believe,Kamina aga gana gan Yea imani jin be yan na soko cin beyn na Ajin agan Yi ye jin imani jin be ya na aga cin be yayi nae acie laajin kafirinci be ndoci na ga dan zuma ubo na alali ma wuncin ga yi gaskiyao natsoe tagwa lawu gaskiya natso gwaabo nao Gan gan kiy be la ye cie wu Annabi soko zhio wunayi gan muminizhi ga yeyi gao nao
There came to you Moses with clear Signs yet ye worshipped the calf Even after that and ye did behave wrongfully,Akika ma Musa be ya ye be bayani yan hujjazhiy gancin yeci da nanko la Tsoci cifewun zumaubo ye cia fe azwalumizhi
And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you the towering height of Mount Sinai Saying Hold firmly to what We have given you and hearken to the Law They saidWe hear and we disobey And they had to drink into their hearts of the taint of the calf because of their Faithlessness Say Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!,Ye mae pa lokaci na yi la alkawali be ye yin na yi cia pati laatu ke eti yezhi lugwana Yi ci gan ye ganyea egwa sun yan na yi laa yaye na be kagboe ye mae fe wogan A ci ganyi wo yi ma navo yi gwoa A cia cin-cin yan nanko wuncin laa sa fia yangbao ebo kafirinciabo Gan gan Tir jam be iri yan nazhi imani ye wunejin ye foro gan yejin na wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na
Say If the last Home with Allah be for you specially and not for anyone else then seek ye for death if ye are sincere,Gan gan wunayi gan Emi yan alkiyami efo zobatsitsaci u yio ya ye daneba soko bo ke zawangizhi kpata lugwao ejin guri yan ajali ebo yedae tsun Soko wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na
But they will never seek for death on account of the sins which their hands have sent on before them and Allah is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers,A maa kara jin guri wuncina har da zoba izhea ebo dansun etun dedezhi nazhi egwaatsozhi lo nao Soko ma yi be kpikpe be iri yanna azwalumizhi ga dany ninbo na
Thou wilt indeed find them of all people most greedy of life-even more than the idolaters Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of a thousand years But the grant of such life will not save him from due punishment For Allah sees well all that they do,Wyo maa tsunn a ga yi za nazhi de cincin rayuwa izhe gan zazhi nao ade cincin izhe gan to za nazhie layan pa Soko baci na zaeni miniabo wunajin ufe wa ko wungaade izhe le yan eya kpautsun wuncin ma uala kpeya wo be azaba yina kaaga yau cia de le na Soko mae cin ale be iri etun nazhie lo na
Say Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the revelation to thy heart by Allah´s will a confirmation of what went before and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe,Gan gan zandondo na ga azhe makiri yan Jibrilu na akika wyun ga cinu be ta eti yangban wyo bo be yarda Soko yino wyune la gaskiya wu yan yannazhi shiudzo na u mayi bawu be yan gban fae ya muminizhi
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers to Gabriel and Michael- Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith,zandondo na ga fe makiri Soko na to yan malaikazhi to yan tucizhi na to yan Jibrilu to Mikailu na to akika Soko tso makiri uyio ya kafirizhi
We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs ayat and none reject them but those who are perverse,Be ma akika yi cin be ya wye ayazhi nazhi yi gbangba na ama-de zanaajin kafirinci beayin naa saide fasikizhi za nazhi le Soko ba gbangba na
Is it not the case that every time they make a covenant some party among them throw it aside- Nay Most of them are faithless,Kashi kandondo na agaa alkawali jinna zandocizhi miniabo uce ya ci zumao Aa ekudondoa ejin imania
And when there came to them a messenger from Allah confirming what was with them a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs as if it had been something they did not know!,Kamina tuci be yaa dagan eba Soko na namae la gaskiyabo wu yan yanna dan ganni be ayin na zandocizhi mini za nazhi ala litafi yana a litafi Soko laace ya ci zumaabo aci fejin bojin ke ad kpikpea na
They followed what the evil ones gave out falsely against the power of Solomon the blasphemers Were not Solomon but the evil ones teaching men Magic and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut But neither of these taught anyone Such things without saying We are only for trial so do not blaspheme They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah´s permission And they learned what harmed them not what profited them And they knew that the buyers of magic would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls if they but knew!,Acia emi tu katun na shaitan egba yaa eti mulki Sulaimauo na Sulaiymanu ma ujin kafirincia ama de shaitanzhi ga jin kafiricio Ela katun sihri eyan ma wu zazhi be yanna acin be ya malaika guba kin yan yan Babilao na waato haruta be marutae Ama la katun wu zandondo lea sai aga ganyau gan akika fitina tsa yiyio eboacino gajin kafirinci ma Ezazhi cife wa ilimi yan nazhi agaagan eba be nyinmiu yin na dagan gwataabo za wunchinzhi na zhie man yan na alaujin zandondo egun woa saide be yeda Sokoe Acie wa kpikpe za yan nazhia jina gun umaajina anfanindondoa na za Daakika ma atso kpe ke zandondo na ga da shi kpikpe dede wuncin na ude rabo ndondo ke dan alkiyamiboa Bibi gwosun wunajin tabbata ya yan na ada shi ganni be rayia yin na daaci gan akpe-kpe na
If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil far better had been the reward from their Lord if they but knew!,Daacin gan be akika a imani jin aci sunda yan Soko da egagba naade dagan nko Soko na uga fe alheri yaa daaci gan ade kpikpi de na
O ye of Faith! Say not to the Messenger words of ambiguous import but words of respect and hearken to him To those without Faith is a grievous punishment,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega gan gan raina ma amma ye gan gan unzurna patp ya yi degi ye mae shitukpa Azaba na ma tan na wunajin tabbata ya kafirizhi Raina kalma uyio na kafirizhi ela lamina
It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book nor of the Pagans that anything good should come down to you from your Lord But Allah will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for Allah is Lord of grace abounding,za nazhiajin kafirinci mini za ba litafi zhio na to za nazhie la yan pa Soko ba ci na e wa gan alhairi ucinu be uyaye dagan eba tsoci yeboa Soko ma wyuajin ula yegunu wyua tsa za na ga ba una Soko ma etsu ba gwo uyi na wancin na

None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten but We substitute something better or similar Knowest thou not that Allah Hath power over all things,Yan ndondo na yi ga finys mini aya ona ko ma yi la aciu batan na yi yia be be natso gye gan na ko ma kwatoniu kashi wyode kpikpe dea ke Soko gboka eti jin jin yandondo naa

Would ye question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old but whoever changeth from Faith to Unbelief Hath strayed without doubt from the even way,Kashiye kpakpa gan ye gbin tuci ye egan iri kendoe agbin Musa gan shidzo batso-zhio na zandondo na ga imani sangwa be kafirinciy na akika za wucina ya ke eko guru lugwa
Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could Turn you people back to infidelity after ye have believed from selfish envy after the Truth hath become Manifest unto them But forgive and overlook Till Allah accomplish His purpose for Allah Hath power over all things,Kun dondo mini zaba litafizhio ejin guri dede na aga ye laazhe kafirizhi baci na ye yea imani jina ni na ebo hasada dede nafi yangbanazhio na baci na gaskiyawuna tulayaa ni na to yea akuri jin ye mae dzun ganabo har da lokaci na Soko be la umurniu be na Akika Soko de iko ta eti yandondo
And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you ye shall find it with Allah for Allah sees Well all that ye do,Ye mae la swallae kue gikini ye mae la zakka dukiya yezhie wa Yan ndondo na ma ye ga la shidzo yan etun alheri na yea da tsun egagbau eba Soko Akika Sokoe cin ye le be iri yandondo na ye gae jin na
And they say None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian Those are their vain desires Say Produce your proof if ye are truthful,Aci ganzandondoade aljanna gan dana saide za na ga yi yahudu ko nasara na wuncin de yi egan ecinzhi nae cin yana na Gan gan ebe be dalili yezhiy wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na
Nay-whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good- He will get his reward with his Lord on such shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Yan nayi gaskiya na zandondo na ga eti tacinu laaya sokona umayi za nae lotun wangizhi na egagba wangi gaajin tabbata yau dan eba tsoci ubo edansun ndondo madanbo yaa amaale yangban nyin yea

And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of Allah Allah´s name should be celebrated-whose zeal is in fact to ruin them It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world and in the world to come an exceeding torment,Zi ma ga wu-ye gan za naa kin kan laadan masallaci soko zhio uci lugwa a tun sunnan soko ye danboa naa yino cie ke lo tun na uga nasallaci laazhe wasa naoWza iri wuncinzhiu gwoyin naa gan dan masallacio Egba be zunyesuny wunajin tabbata yaa dan izheo na ma wancin na gaajin tabbata yaa efo alkiyamiy
To Allah belong the east and the West Whithersoever ye turn there is the presence of Allah For Allah is all-Pervading all-Knowing,Soko ma uga wun eyi lazhin to eyi lozuno bandondo na ye ga zhe ye lo na baga bo fuska soko latu dano akika soko etsu bagwo uyio etsu kpikpe ma uyio
They say Allah hath begotten a son Glory be to Him-Nay to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth everything renders worship to Him,Aci gansoko yi be egiylili kpata ajin tabbata ya sokoAa yandondo na fi samao to kinbo na soko wuna o kpata ma egbagba yau

Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion Say The Guidance of Allah-that is the only Guidance Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against Allah,Yahudazhi to nasarazhi aga jin yeda be yandondo na ga fe be gwata wyobonaa sai de wyo ga mituekpa yan adinia ganganakika bawu yan soko ugayi bawuo wyo ma ga mitu etun yangbanazhi baci yan kpikpe na be ya wye dagan ilimio na wyoade ndakata nko yan soko boawyo maade zando naajino taimako naa

And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands which he fulfilled He said I will make thee an Imam to the Nations He pleaded And also Imams from my offspring!

And remember Abraham said My Lord make this a City of Peace and feed its people with fruits-such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day He said Yea and such as reject Faith-for a while will I grant them their pleasure but will soon drive them to the torment of Fire- an evil destination indeed!,To lokaci na Ibrahim gan-gan tsoci !a ezhi nana laafe ezhi aminci wyo mao la arzikioya jamaa na zhi fi bo na be yangici sunsuzhiy to za nazhi ga imani jin miniabo be sokoe be efo zobae na Soko ci ganto za na ga jin kafirimci na mia yau emawo yan ekadegi gancin micia jinu kpaka da gun azaba yan enao lallai zoba maabiye

We see the turning of thy face for guidance to the heavens now Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee Turn then Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque Wherever ye are turn your faces in that direction The people of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord Nor is Allah unmindful of what they do,Akika yi le eye na wyoe zhe lo sanma na ye eboacino yi ga fuska wye zheban da alkibla natso wyoa jin yeda beyin na To a fuska wye zheban da kasanta yan masalaci yan harami beani ndodo na ma yega dan na yea fuska yezhi zhebanda kasanta wuncin Akika ma za nazhia la litafi ya na atso kpe ke nana gaskiya uyio na febe dagan eba Tsociabo na Soko ma yaye ke etun nazhi ye lo na lugwaa
Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the Signs together they would not follow Thy Qibla nor art thou going to follow their Qibla nor indeed will they follow each other´s Qibla If thou after the knowledge hath reached thee Wert to follow their vain desires-then wert thou Indeed clearly in the wrong,Akika ma ka wyo ga aya yan hujja kpata labe aya za nazhia la litafi ya na aga lamitu alkibla wyo yaa wyotso maalamitu Alkibla yanaya ka sashi mini atso zhio ma aga lamitu alkibla yansashizhiaAkika ma wyo ga emitu yangbaazhi baci yannazhi be ya wyoe mini kpikpeo na akika wyoe kanga wyo gaafe dan mini azwalumi zhio
The people of the Book know this as they know their own sons but some of them conceal the truth which they themselves know,Za nazhi yi la litafi ya na ekpeu ye sarauyin kendoe e kpe egi maciazhi ye naAkika zandocizhi miniabo ajin afeso gaskiya atso ma kpeacin
The Truth is from thy Lord so be not at all in doubt,Gaskiya dedagan eba Tsoci wyobo wunefe beo ebo acinoga lugwa wyobo wunefe dan mini za nazhie jin kelokezhi-n na ma
To each is a goal to which Allah turns him then strive together as in a race Towards all that is good Wheresoever ye are Allah will bring you Together For Allah Hath power over all things,Jamaandodo mauyi be Alkibla bana ula eyewu na Ebo acino efe sa gana be dozhi dan etun alherizhio Bandodo na ma yega dan na soko gae la bea keba nio Akika soko de Iko eti yandondo
From whencesoever Thou startest forth turn Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque that is indeed the truth from the Lord And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do,Baeni ndodo na wyo ga tinya na a fuska wye zheda kasanta yan masallaci Harami akika jin jin wuncingaskiya uyio etun nazhi yelo na lugwaa
So from whencesoever Thou startest forth turn Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque and wheresoever ye are Turn your face thither that there be no ground of dispute against you among the people except those of them that are bent on wickedness so fear them not but fear Me and that I may complete My favours on you and ye May consent to be guided,Baeni ndondo na wyoga tinya lo na a fuska wyoe zhe da kasanta yan masallaci harami bandondo na ma yega dan baenio na yea fuska yezhi zhe da kasantau ebo zandocizhi be de hujja ndoci ta eti yebo ma Ebo acino ega sundanama mi tsa yea sundan wuno ebo ma minla niima mingunminta efi yebo ujin-wo be wunciny ye gaake eko
A similar favour have ye already received in that We have sent among you a Messenger of your own rehearsing to you Our Signs and sanctifying you and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom and in new knowledge,Kendoe yi tun Tuci fiye mini yebo n a ga dano naoU cie gba aya yizhi yaye umae ta yedzu umaela ilimi yan litafi be hikimazhiy wuye umaela kpikpe wuye yan yanazhi yekpe shiboa na

O ye who believe! seek help with patient perseverance and prayer for Allah is with those who patiently persevere,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ewa taimako be jin jin hakuriy be kuku gikini yan swallaeAkika taimako Soko wune danbe za nazhie jin hakuri na
And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah They are dead Nay they are living though ye perceive it not,Ye mae ga gan gan za nazhiy wu ta eti etun Sokonaatsu yama Aa ayi be rayi eba Soko ammaade ye ye wo san-san wuncina
Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger some loss in goods or lives or the fruits of your toil but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere,Yi ma ma ye cinle be ndonci yan dansuny kandocibe madane kandocibe kike yan dukiyazhiy kandoci berayi kandocibe yangici latizhiy ammaa yangban fa gaajin tabbata ya za nazhi jin hakuri na
Who say when afflicted with calamity To Allah We belong and to Him is our return-,Za nazhi kamina miman-cinle gadea naajin agan ganAkika yi Soko wunyiyio akika ma ebauga yi mazheban lo
They are those on whom Descend blessings from Allah and Mercy and they are the ones that receive guidance,Eza wuncinzhi aduwa albarka be egwa gane beyeguny wunajin tabbata ta eti abo dagan eba TsociaboZa wuncinzhi ma agayi eza bawu zhio
Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times should compass them round it is no sin in them And if any one obeyeth his own impulse to good- be sure that Allah is He Who recogniseth and knoweth,Akika patizhi yan safa be marumae adan mini danna cinwanci yan baeta Soko ebo acino zandondo na ga jin haji ko Umura nalefi danboya wyuna na wyunajin da lo dazhin dan tsakaniabo naa Zanama ga be jin jin yan etun alheri ta eti wuncio na To hakika soko Etsu yebo na uyio Etsu nade kpikpe yan dondo na uyio
Those who conceal the clear Signs We have sent down and the Guidance after We have made it clear for the people in the Book-on them shall be Allah´s curse and the curse of those entitled to curse,Akika za nazhie swo yananzhi yi cin beyn mini hujja nazhi yi gbangba na ganni be bawuy na baci na yiu jin bayaniya zazhi fi litafi boani na za wuncizhi soko gaabomiza nazhi makun a bo za mi wonaafe boami
Except those who repent and make amends and openly declare the Truth To them I turn for I am Oft-returning Most Merciful,Sai de za nazhi ga tuba jin na acia etunazhi yejin aci kezhea bayani bayani jin wangi na Za wuncin zhi miafa beyino Akikama mi ga ma yi Etsu yeguno
Those who reject Faith and die rejecting- on them is Allah´s curse and the curse of angels and of all mankind,Akika za nazhi jin kafirinci na haracia jin ajali eti kafirincio na za wuncinzhi emibo yan Soko ta etiabo to emibo yan malaikazhi to emibo yan zawangizhi baenio
They will abide therein Their penalty will not be lightened nor will respite be their lot,Ba gaboafi tutunyin oa jin sawki azaba yaa amaacin ta yaa
And your Allah is One Allah There is no god but He Most Gracious Most Merciful,Soko nyan ye ma Soko Nini uyio ade Soko ndocia sai wyin Etsutosayi Etsu yegun
Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth in the alternation of the night and the day in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the profit of mankind in the rain which Allah Sends down from the skies and the life which He gives therewith to an earth that is dead in the beasts of all kinds that He scatters through the earth in the change of the winds and the clouds which they Trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth- Here indeed are Signs for a people that are wise,Akika minialitta yan samazhio to kin to egbazhe yan yeshi be igidiy to eya nazhie dazan ta eti eduo be yanna zawangizhie lajin anfani na to nuwan ele na Soko duzhin dagan samao Ucia kin dan rayi baci yan tsutsuubo na ucia dabbazhi iri ndondo laasheu to efe narku na to girgije na Sokojin foro dan tsakani sama be kin yin na akika ayazhi nae wugwa zankpe Soko na fi miniabo ya za nazhi ga ankali na
Yet there are men who take for worship others besides Allah as equal with Allah They love them as they should love Allah But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for Allah If only the unrighteous could see behold they would see the penalty that to Allah belongs all power and Allah will strongly enforce the penalty,Amade dan mini zawangizhio za nazhie da lagwasun yandoci ke Soko lugwa na acie la zawuncinzhi la ke yezunzhi na ya Soko  Acie de cicin ya  ke cincin Soko na alali ma za nazhi jin imani na ede cincin Soko sarauyin Daaci gan za nazhi jin zwalunci naa taye leye lokaci na aga le azaba ye na atsoa kpewo kanga kede kagbo kpata Soko wuno na ama akpe wo ke de akika Soko Gbota eba azaba jino na
Then would those who are followed clear themselves of those who follow them  They would see the penalty and all relations between them would be cut off,Kamina dzoshici nazhia agbake Soko lugwanaaga agwaazhi wa be za nazhi fe gba ana atsoa taye le azaba yegancin ekpa nazhie petu na ciga baya
And those who followed would say If only We had one more chance We would clear ourselves of them as they have cleared themselves of us Thus will Allah show them The fruits of their deeds as nothing but regrets Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire,Talakanazhi la mitu dzoshicizhi na ci gan Daaci gan yide dama ndoci de bedayi ga egwayi wa bea yin kendoe atso wagwaabe yi yin na A cinga ga Sokoela etunazhi wuao acie ti ro-- nkpe etiabo amakara de dzun tinya dagan azaba enaboa
O ye people! Eat of what is on earth Lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of the evil one for he is to you an avowed enemy,Ya ye zawangizhi! Egi mini yan nazhi fi kinbo na Yanna gayi halali umayi wangi na Yemae ga lamitu ekpa shaitanzhi ma akika shaitan makiri yezhi uyio nayi gbangba na
For he commands you what is evil and shameful and that ye should say of Allah that of which ye have no knowledge,Akika wyunejin ye foro jin be etun dede be etun alfashae umae jin ye foro gan ye gab gan lo eba Soko yan yannazhi yetso kpea na
When it is said to them Follow what Allah hath revealed They say Nay! we shall follow the ways of our fathers What! even though their fathers Were void of wisdom and guidance,Ama ga gan ganYae emi tu yan na Soko cin beyn naAjin agan ganAa yide ga mitu yanna yi kpeyecitsun ndayizhi ta etiabo na kashi ade kpikpe de gan Babaazhiade yekpa wangizhia naa amade bawuayana
The parable of those who reject Faith is as if one were to shout Like a goat-herd to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries Deaf dumb and blind they are void of wisdom,Kotonci yan za naeyi kafirizhi na uyi ke kotonci zanae ti wu yi dabbazhi nazhie wogana sa ide kabara be ewutiy na tukpa tecizhi edingizhi yebon cizhi ugaayio amade ankali a
O ye who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for you and be grateful to Allah if it is Him ye worship,Ya ye nazhia imanijin na! egi dagan mini eyan lilicizhi na yi laaya ye arziki nao ye nae fe jin yeboeya Soko wunayi wyun ga ye yewun-wun yan gaskya ona
He hath only forbidden you dead meat and blood and the flesh of swine and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of Allah But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits- then is he guiltless For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Akika yan nazhi de ala jin haramu yaye na u gayi musari toegya ton nakan kputsun be yan naazun eti yanwo ya zandoci na jin Sokoo naAmmaza na eba ga be yibau na Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun Uyio
Those who conceal Allah´s revelations in the Book and purchase for them a miserable profit- they swallow into themselves naught but Fire Allah will not address them on the Day of Resurrection Nor purify them Grievous will be their penalty,Akika zanazhie swo-yan nazhi Sokocin beyn dan mini litafio na acie da lau shi ewo tetengi beuyin na za wuncizhi yan nazhiegi fi gbakoabo na ufea saide enaSokoma agan-gan bea yin EfoAlkiyami yinaumaalia azaba na ma tan na gaajin tabbata yaa
They are the ones who buy Error in place of Guidance and Torment in place of Forgiveness Ah! what boldness They show for the Fire!,Za wuncinzhi agayi za nazhia agbin shi be bawui nao amaazaba shi be gafarae ngba ke zan nazhi ajin hakuri jin wobe enae nao
Their doom is because Allah sent down the Book in truth but those who seek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism Far from the purpose,Wuncin ma yi ebo na Soko cin litafi cin zhin leba dan mini litafio na afe dan minicice leba na akpe ya be gaskiyae na
It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day and the Angels and the Book and the Messengers to spend of your substance out of love for Him for your kin for orphans for the needy for the wayfarer for those who ask and for the ransom of slaves to be steadfast in prayer and practice regular charity to fulfil the contracts which ye have made and to be firm and patient in pain or suffering and adversity and throughout all periods of panic Such are the people of truth the Allah-fearing,U jin jin-jin adini wangay uga yi fuska yezhi na yeazhe lo kansanta eyi lozun ko eyi lazhe naa ammade jin jin adini wangi uga yi za nagaskiya ya be Sokoe nao ucia ya be efo zobae be malaikazhiy be litafi be annabizhiyucie wu dukiya natso uyiware na ya dangizhi to ekungizhi to ezagwagbagizhi to eyan swallaku gikini ucie wa zakka dukiyauzhi to za nazhie she alkawali nazhi aga jin na to za zhie jin hakuri hali yan bayibao be hali eguny na to lokaci yan ekuny na za wuncinzhi aga yiza gaskiyazhio aga mayi zanazhie sundan Soko nao

O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder the free for the free the slave for the slave the woman for the woman But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with handsome gratitude this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty,Yaye nazhia imani jin na!

It is prescribed when death approaches any of you if he leave any goods that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin according to reasonable usage this is due from the Allah-fearing,A mauulaajin wajibi ta eti yebo kamina ajali gadabe ya zaeni miniebo na Uga lu dukiya ndoci gwa dan zumao na ula wasiyya ujinu ya yanmaci gubaba to dangizhi eti eko gboro Nana ma wajibi uyio ta eti za nazhi gae sundan Soko na

Fasting for a fixed number of days but if any of you is ill or on a journey the prescribed number Should be made up from days later For those who can do it With hardship is a ransom the feeding of one that is indigent But he that will give more of his own free will- it is better for him And it is better for you that ye fast if ye only knew,Azun yan efo nazhi yi bibachizhi na uyio ebo acino za na ga bea afe u wo maa mini ebo na koma uta eti ezhi lona upa ta wo ammauga adadi efo nazhiuga ban na ga da efo ndocizhio za nazhi- ma fifeu gaazhe wahala yaa na sisa danbo ugayi yangici naala ya talakazhi gi nao za na ga be alheri ndoci eti wuncio na akika alheri ga wunayi ya wuno amma azun na yeafe na ujin alheri gan ya ye wunayi gan ye kpekpe na
Ramadhan is the month in which was sent down the Qur´an as a guide to mankind also clear Signs for guidance and judgment Between right and wrong So every one of you who is present at his home during that month should spend it in fasting but if any one is ill or on a journey the prescribed period Should be made up by days later Allah intends every facility for you He does not want to put to difficulties He wants you to complete the prescribed period and to glorify Him in that He has guided you and perchance ye shall be grateful,Etswa yan Azum RAMADAN ugayi etswa naa ca cincin yan alkuranu nao bawu uyio ya zawangizhi u mae jin bayani be hujjazhiy ganni be egan yekpezhiy zandondo na ga dan rayio dan mini etswa azun bo na sai wyunula azun yinufe Ko ma uta eti ezanzhilo na wyun ula azun yinugaudan mini efo ndocizhio yegboro Sokoe kpa bayiba ndondo be ye yina Ebo acino yea adadi efo azun gun mi ye mae wan Sokoe cin eti bawu nau wu ye na wataki-la be wunciny ye gafe za nazhie jin yebo ya Soko na

When Talut set forth with the armies he said Allah will test you at the stream if any drinks of its water He goes not with my army Only those who taste not of it go with me A mere sip out of the hand is excused but they all drank of it except a few When they crossed the river- He and the faithful ones with him- they said This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah said How oft by Allah´s will Hath a small force vanquished a big one Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere,Kamina Dalutu bea dzun tinya be ekungunciuzhina ugan Akika Sokoa maye cinle be edu nuwan ndoci zandondo na ga to nuwan fin miniubo na za wuncin dan mini zabamizhi boa za na ma lau to misun wyuna na Akika zawuncin dan mini mibo sai de za na ga to gwako nini be egwauyin na Kundondoa ci da tou fin kendoe baa na sai de za degi miniabo Kamina Dalutu bea patu gan-ni be za na zhia imani jin gan-ni beu yin na za nazhitwo nuwan finana ci gan Nyin na yi de kagbo ndondo nayi ga zheye ka Dalutu be ekun gunciuzhi-naa zanazhia gaskiya ya ke ada gun be Sokoena cigan Gukin gukino jamaa nazhi yi degi na e laade zankpe ta eti jamaa nazhi dokun na be izini Soko yino Soko ma wyunajin udanbe hakuri jincizhiy
When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces they prayed Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm Help us against those that reject faith,Kamina adzun fi jaluta be ekun gunciuzhi-na aci gan Ya wyoe Tsociyan yi! Dule hakuri fi yi nakao wyo mao la bici kimpayizhio gboka wyo mao ya yi nasara ta eti jamaayan kafirizhio
By Allah´s will they routed them and David slew Goliath and Allah gave him power and wisdom and taught him whatever else He willed And did not Allah Check one set of people by means of another the earth would indeed be full of mischief But Allah is full of bounty to all the worlds,Acia rukpea be izini Sokoe Dawuda cia Jalutu wu Soko cia mulki to hikima laa yau uci wuu ilimi yan nazhi wyune wa na kagan ujin ebo gwakan Soko boa na wyune la sashi zazhi kangwa ya sashi naa da kin gaajin lalace Amma ade Soko Etsu falala uyio ta eti alitzhi kpatao
These are the Signs of Allah we rehearse them to thee in truth verily Thou art one of the messengers,Wucinzhi kpata ayazhi ayio yan Soko Nae gba yawyoe be gaskiyae naakika ma wyo yea fe dan mini tuci zhio
Those messengers We endowed with gifts some above others To one of them Allah spoke others He raised to degrees of honour to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear Signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit If Allah had so willed succeeding generations would not have fought among each other after clear Signs had come to them but they chose to wrangle some believing and others rejecting If Allah had so willed they would not have fought each other but Allah Fulfilleth His plan,Tuci wuncinzhi yi yia daraja laaya sashiazhi ta eti sashio ade dan miniabo na Soko gangan bayin na Umaa sashiazhi laatu be darajazhi yima hujjazhi laaya Isa egi Maryama yici kezhe u ya kagbo be Ruhiy na yi lilici na Umaaba Soko ba da za nazhi be gbaazuma naagun kuna baci na hujjazhi nazhia tula na be yaa ni naa ammaade ace dozhi leba ebo acino ade dan miniabo za nazhia imani jin na amade dan miniabo nazhia jin kafirinci na Da wuna ba Soko ba agun dozhi kuna amma ade Sokoajin ujin yan na ga bau na
O ye who believe! Spend out of the bounties We have provided for you before the Day comes when no bargaining Will avail nor friendship nor intercession Those who reject Faith they are the wrong-doers,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na ewu dukiyayezhi mini nazhi yila ya ye arziki nao tun shidzo kafi Efo ube na efo na e cewo boa na eyada madanboa na gwatan ndondoma danboa na Akika kafirizhi agayi azwalumizhio
Allah! There is no god but He-the Living the Self-subsisting Eternal No slumber can seize Him nor sleep His are all things in the heavens and on earth Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth He knoweth what appeareth to His creatures as before or after or behind them Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High the Supreme in glory,Soko ade tsoci ndocia sai wyiny Etsu rayi Etsu na akunke ya ti  u be yandondoe na igbe ta wune la wyuna to elele ma wune la wyuna wyun ga wun yan na fi samazhi to yan na fi kinbo nao ziy-kun acin u tangwa ugi nko ubo sai de be iziniuyin Uyi be kpikpe yan nazhi dan yegboroabo na to nazhi dan zuma abo na Ama ma yandondo kezhe mini ilimiu boa sai natso ga bau na Esa yan mulkiu wuna ma samazhi to kin yin gwoba kangia be tswitswaa yin ulu kpin ndondo fi wyuna wyun ga mayi Etsu na latu ta eti yandondo nao Etsu nayi cinwan ci na
Let there be no compulsion in religion Truth stands out clear from Error whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold that never breaks And Allah heareth and knoweth all things,Tiile bo ko kpaka bo udan mini jin jin adini boa ya zana laagwo musuluncia naa Akika bawu wuna tula kperi be egbiny ebo acino zandondo na ga kafirici jinbe Dagutuy na zanae jin zazhi umurni be wunwun zandoci ke Soko lugwa na u cia imani jin be Sokoe na akika za wuncina egwa laasun egban na gboka sarauyin nana maadza yaa na Soko ma Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu nade kpikpe yandondo na uyi
Allah is the Protector of those who have faith from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness They will be companions of the fire to dwell therein For ever,Soko ga yi Ndakata yan za nazhia imani jin nao wyune kuadzun tinya dagan bazhiko zhio lo haske za nazhi maajin kafirinci na Ndakataazhi gayi Dagutuo ajin afe kuatinya dagan haskeo lo bazhikozhi Za wuncinzhi ga yi egi mina zhio bagabo a fi tutunyino
Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About his Lord because Allah had granted him power Abraham said My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death He said I give life and death Said Abraham But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east Do thou then cause him to rise from the West Thus was he confounded who in arrogance rejected faith Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust,Ngba wyu le ye eba za na gbomi be Ibrahimae dan mini alamari Tsocioubo ebo mulki na Soko laayau naa lokaci na Ibrahima gan Tsoci mi gae dan eyan rayio wyu ga mae wu rayio Ugan Tomi tsoe dan yan rayi mi mae wu rayi Ibrahima gan To akika Sokoe elaigidi tinya dagan eyi laazhino ebo acino wyotsoo la wuno tinoya dagan eyi lozuno acia za naajin kafirinci na laagizhi dan zunyesuno Soko mae la jamaayan azwalumizhi ke eoa
Or take the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet all in ruins to its roofs He said Oh! how shall Allah bring it ever to life after this its death but Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then raised him up again He said How long didst thou tarry thus He said Perhaps a day or part of a day He said Nay thou hast tarried thus a hundred years but look at thy food and thy drink they show no signs of age and look at thy donkey And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people Look further at the bones how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh When this was shown clearly to him he said I know that Allah hath power over all things,Koma ke za na -- gan alkarya ndocio na alalima wun azhe wasa ta eti eyankouzhio uci gan ke Soko zhezhe ci dan kin nana rayi baci tsutsuubo nao Sokocia wuntso wu har yan eya shitsun zuma wuncino uciu laa nakin be rayiy Uci gbin ugan gan Ke efo jin wyoe yiyinao Ugan mi fe foe ni ko ma sashi yan efo nini Ugan Aa wyo fe eya shittsunaniCin le lo eba yangici wyoe to eyan finci wyoe ade na zhegba miniabo naa wyo mao cinoleolo eba tyatyagi wyoe ebo ma yi la wyo yolaofe aya ndociy ya zawangizhi Wyo mao cin-oleolo eba tsukunzhi kendoe yie sana san na yicie kezhe la tufuwa yan nakan kpea na Gancin kamina alamari bea tula yau na ugan mi kpe ke Soko de kagbo ta eti yandondo na
When Abraham said Show me Lord how You will raise the dead  He replied Have you no faith He said Yes but just to reassure my heart Allah said Take four birds draw them to you and cut their bodies to pieces Scatter them over the mountain-tops then call them back They will come swiftly to you Know that Allah is Mighty Wise,To lokaci na Ibrahima gan gan Tsoci!

The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of Allah is that of a grain of corn it groweth seven ears and each ear Hath a hundred grains Allah giveth manifold increase to whom He pleaseth And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things,Kotonci yan za nazhie wu dukiyaazhi fi eko Soko na uyi ke kotonci yan eyisunsun naayin egwa gutwaba na mini egwa ndondo yangici sunsun shitsun fi bo Soko maajin Ukpe u badozhi ya za na ga bau na Sokoma Etsu bagwo uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio
Those who spend their substance in the cause of Allah and follow not up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury-for them their reward is with their Lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Za nazhie wu dukiyaazhi fi eko Soko na gancin ma elazhisa be eguny a gba yan na a wuna zumaa na ayibe laadayin dan eba Soko dansun ndondo maadan bea yina amaa nyin yangban ndodoa
O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury- like those who spend their substance to be seen of men but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day They are in parable like a hard barren rock on which is a little soil on it falls heavy rain which leaves it Just a bare stone They will be able to do nothing with aught they have earned And Allah guideth not those who reject faith,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

And the likeness of those who spend their substance seeking to please Allah and to strengthen their souls is as a garden high and fertile heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest and if it receives not Heavy rain light moisture sufficeth it Allah seeth well whatever ye do,Kotonci ma yan za nazhie wu dukyaazhi ebo wiwayan yardajin yan Soko na be kagbo yan yangban atsozhi eba imanio na uyi ke kotonci yan batako ndoci na ta eti patio na eleko yan albarka cia du kpeu na Uci nyin anfani latizhi tinya-kpeba dozhi guba tobo otso eleko du fi wuna ka elekpa nae cin na wuna kunuke Soko mae cin yele be iri etun nazhi ye lo na

Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vines and streams flowing underneath and all kinds of fruit while he is stricken with old age and his children are not strong enough to look after themselves- that it should be caught in a whirlwind with fire therein and be burnt up Thus doth Allah make clear to you His Signs that ye may consider,Kashi eza dan mini yebo nae wa gan wyunu yi bebatako yan donbinazhi to yinabizhi na manuwanzhie je fi tako ubo na yangici sunsun iri ndondo ma ashe u wyuntso ci bea kuku umayi be zuriyazhi nazhi laagboka na gancin efe ko ndoci na enafinin yinubo na cibea lati din na Ngba ade za na awa acin na Acinga ga Sokoe jin bayani yan ayauzhi ya ye yeo ujin wo be wunciny ye ga fe zanazhia kpa ye na
O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have honourably earned and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad in order that out of it ye may give away something when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes And know that Allah is Free of all wants and worthy of all praise,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly Allah promiseth you His forgiveness and bounties And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things,Shetan wyinejin ye alkawali yaji jin umae jinye umurni be lulo yan etun alfashae Soko mae jin ye alkawali yan etun gafara be falalae dagan eba ubo Sokoma Etsu bagwo uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio
He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth and he to whom wisdom is granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing but none will grasp the Message but men of understanding,Wyun ela hikima fahimta gaskiya a twarya ya za na ga ba una zandondo na ma aga hikima laaya na akika aza wuncin ya alherina dokun na A made za na akpaye naa sai de za nazhi gayi eza hankalizhi na
And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion be sure Allah knows it all But the wrong-doers have no helpers,Yandondo na ye ga wu mini dukiyaezhio na ba na wunagbagba da kan na koma emi yan alkawali ndoci na ye ga shena akika Soko yi be kpikpeu yin Azwalumizhi maade zanazhia jinataimako naa
If ye disclose acts of charity even so it is well but if ye conceal them and make them reach those really in need that is best for you It will remove from you some of your stains of evil And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do,Ye ga swadakazhi laatula to ugye sarauyin yema gauswo ye cia laaya talakazhi wucintso de alheri gan yaye Soko ma ga ndoncizhi mini zunubi yezhio fin ya Soko ma yi be kpikpe etun nazhi yelo na
It is not required of thee O Messenger to set them on the right path but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth Whatever of good ye give benefits your own souls and ye shall only do so seeking the Face of Allah Whatever good ye give shall be rendered back to you and ye shall not Be dealt with unjustly,Eko kea udan egwa wyoboa ammaade Soko ajin ula za na ga bau na ake eko Yandondo na ma ye ga wu yan alheri na eti tacin yetso ye wu yao yandondo na ma ye ga wuna sai ebo wiwa yan yarda Soko bo ya wuo Yandondo na ye ga wu mini alherio na Soko ga laadau gunmi ya ye ama ajin ye zwaluncia
Charity is for those in need who in Allah´s cause are restricted from travel and cannot move about in the land seeking For trade or work the ignorant man thinks because of their modesty that they are free from want Thou shalt know them by their Unfailing mark They beg not importunately from all the sundry And whatever of good ye give be assured Allah knoweth it well,Efe wu dukiya ya talakazhi nazhia eyanzhi laakana ebo ezan naeda yankokari ta eti ekpa Sokona ade kagbo naalo bandondo wo be naa za na kpea na ga leaye wyun aye gan ko eyandecizhio ebo minia nae wan nao Wyoa kpeaye be alaamazhiy ejin zawangizhi bara wawuya yina yandondo na ye ga wu mini alherio na akika Soko yi be kpikpe uyin

Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness That is because they say Trade is like usury but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury Those who after receiving direction from their Lord desist shall be pardoned for the past their case is for Allah to judge but those who repeat The offence are companions of the Fire They will abide therein for ever,Za nazhie gi ewo riba na yan naabe ta eti lisafio na a nakin efo alkiyami boa sai de kendoe zana efe shetanda zhe nakan cia togwa na kendoe wyun e nakin nana Wuncin mayi ebo na atsoe gan gan akika woce ke riba na uyio Sokoma awoce laazhe halali umaariba laazhe haramu Ebo acino zandondo na waazi ga beyau dagan eba Tsociubona Ucia egwalu laadan etun dedeo na Sokoa fa be natso -- gananina alamariuma danbe Sokoe zana ma gake dazhin lulo etun dede be nato za wuncinzhi ga yiegi mina zhio bagabo maafi tutun yino
Allah will deprive usury of all blessing but will give increase for deeds of charity For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked,Sokoe la albarka wa ewo ribao umae la bibe albarka dan ewo swadaka zhio Soko mae wa zandondo na gae  jin kafirinci naa umae wa zana ejin lefi naa
Those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and establish regular prayers and regular charity will have their reward with their Lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Akika za nazhia imani jin na aci kelo etun wangizhi na acia swallazhi kugikini na acia zakka dukiya azhi wa na ayi be laada ayin dan eba Tsucia bo dansun ndondo madan bea yina amaaleyangbannyin yea

O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time reduce them to writing Let a scribe write down faithfully as between the parties let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah Has taught him so let him write Let him who incurs the liability dictate but let him fear His Lord Allah and not diminish aught of what he owes If they party liable is mentally deficient or weak or unable Himself to dictate Let his guardian dictate faithfully and get two witnesses out of your own men and if there are not two men then a man and two women such as ye choose for witnesses so that if one of them errs the other can remind her The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on For evidence Disdain not to reduce to writing your contract for a future period whether it be small or big it is juster in the sight of Allah More suitable as evidence and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves but if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing But take witness whenever ye make a commercial contract and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm If ye do such harm it would be wickedness in you So fear Allah For it is Good that teaches you And Allah is well acquainted with all things If ye are on a journey and cannot find a scribe a pledge with possession may serve the purpose And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another let the trustee faithfully discharge his trust and let him Fear his Lord conceal not evidence for whoever conceals it - his heart is tainted with sin And Allah knoweth all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

 He said It is my rod on it I lean with it I beat down fodder for my flocks and in it I find other uses,Musa ci gan Tsunkun mi uyio na mie kpetso na mi maajin-nfe fini ya dabba mizhi beuyin mi mae wo bukata ndocizhi beuyin be
Allah said Throw it O Moses!,Soko ci gan Ciu cici Musa!
 He threw it and behold! It was a snake active in motion,Uciu ce cici edagao ma wunazhe ewa-ko ndoci nae dazan na
 Allah said Seize it and fear not We shall return it at once to its former condition,Ugan Agwa sunu wyo mao ga sundan ma Yi gau laa kezhe daa kendoe uyi- yan
Now draw thy hand close to thy side It shall come forth white and shining without harm or stain- as another Sign-,Wyo mao la egwa wyo yo okuofi lukontata wyo bo ugaa bokunyeyan-gun ndondo madanboa nana ma aya ndoci uyio kaa yin
 In order that We may show thee two of our Greater Signs,Nana mayi ebo YiI la yandociI wu wyoe mini aya wanciko-ko yan Yi zhio
 Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds,Fe lo eba Firauna hakika wyune gbin iyaka tu

 Allah said Granted is thy prayer O Moses!,UganHakika yannazhi wyo ba kpaata na Sokoa gwo jin yao
And indeed We conferred a favour on thee another time before,Hakika ma Yi twarya alherizhi ya wyoe dan lokaci ndocizhiobe
 Behold! We sent to thy mother by inspiration the message,Kamina Yijin wahayi ya nna wyoe yannazhi -- yin Yia la jin wahayi yau na
 ´Throw the child into the chest and throw the chest into the river the river will cast him up on the bank and he will be taken up by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him´ But I cast the garment of love over thee from Me and this in order that thou mayest be reared under Mine eye,A egi bobongi wuncin ce gun mini kpatio ye cie la wyune ce gun mini eduo edu ciu ce wyunu lo nuwan misun gancin makiri Mi to makiri wyuntso cia beu la Mi maa boye laayau dagan nko Mibo ma ala wyo-yaa kpa be eye ladan yan Mi yin
Behold! thy sister goeth forth and saith ´shall I show you one who will nurse and rear the child´ So We brought thee back to thy mother that her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve Then thou didst slay a man but We saved thee from trouble and We tried thee in various ways Then didst thou tarry a number of years with the people of Midian Then didst thou come hither as ordained ,O Moses!Kamina yegi wyoe fe dazan uci fe gan ganNgba yea lugwa Mi wueba lo eba zanaa kpau ya ye wangiinaa Gancin Yicia wyo lazhin eba nna wyo be ebo yangban wyunu ciuuta u mau ga nyin yangba maWyo ma jin sanadi tsutsu rayi ndoci Yi cia wyo wadzun dagan yangban nyin wuncino Yi ma ma wyo cinle be mimancinlezhi kakayin Gancin wyoci fedun eye na dakun na dan mini jamaa yan Madyanazhio gbaani wyoci dabe babo eti tsunwan yan na Mi kpa be wyo yin na Musa

Go both of you to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds,Efe lo ebo Firauna zagubabae hakika wyuna gbin tu
 Go both of you to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds,Efe lo ebo Firauna zagubabae hakika wyuna gbin tu
But speak to him mildly perchance he may take warning or fear Allah,Ye mae gangan beuyin be bere didaciy ujin-wo be wunciny wyuna -- sinsantu ko ma wyuna sundan azabaSoko
 They Moses and Aaron said Our Lord! We fear lest he hasten with insolence against us or lest he transgress all bounds,Aci gan Tsoci yi! Hakika Yi ye de dansun ube ke fiyi ma ko ma ube gboti ka ugbin iyakatu be yi yin ma
He said Fear not for I am with you I hear and see everything,Soko ci gan E ga sundan ma hakika Mi dan ganni be ye yin Mie wo Mi mae le yandondo ye
So go ye both to him and say ´Verily we are messengers sent by thy Lord Send forth therefore the Children of Israel with us and afflict them not with a Sign indeed have we come from thy Lord! and peace to all who follow guidance!,Ebo acino efe lo bau ye cie ganu gan Hakika Tuci Tsoci wyo zhi yi yio ebo acino a Bani-Israilazhi ya yayi wyo mao ga jina azaba ma Hakika yi be be ya wyo be ayae dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo Aminci ma ugaajin tabbata ya zana ga mitu bawu na
´Verily it has been revealed to us that the Penalty awaits those who reject and turn away´,Hakika Yi ajin wahayi be yayi gan kede hakika azaba ugaajin tabbata ya zandondo na ga gaskiya yi ganmana na uci kezhea zunma zhetau na
When this message was delivered Pharaoh said Who then O Moses is the Lord of you two,UganZiima yi Tsoci ye yeo tso Musa
 When this message was delivered Pharaoh said Who then O Moses is the Lord of you twoUganZiima yi Tsoci ye yeo tso Musa,
He said Our Lord is He Who gave to each created thing its form and nature and further gave it guidance,Ugan Tsoci yi gayi Etsu na la yandondo ya alittau nao gancin uciu wu bao
Pharaoh said What then is the condition of previous generations,Firauna ci gan To gbani hali iri kicibo allumma yan mafari nazhi shidzo na dan-yninbo gbanio
He replied The knowledge of that is with my Lord duly recorded my Lord never errs nor forgets-Ugan,kpikpe wuncin eba Tsoci mi bo udano dan mini Litafi Lauhil mahfuz Tsoci mi mae gbinka danboa Umae battana
He Who has made for you the earth like a carpet spread out has enabled you to go about therein by roads and channels and has sent down water from the sky With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate from the others,Etsu wuncin na ta kincici yaye parae na Ucia ekpazhi laadan nin yanubo yaye Uci du ele zhin dagan sanmao Yici la yangici sun-sunzhi iriirizhi tinya be nuwan wuncin-y
 Eat for yourselves and pasture your cattle verily in this are Signs for men endued with understanding,Yetso gi dagan miniubo ye mae kpa dabbayezhi Hakika mini wuncino ayazhi danbo ya zanazhi gayi eza hankali zhi na
From the earth did We create you and into it shall We return you and from it shall We bring you out once again,Dagan mini kinbo ga Yi jin alitta ye yeo miniubo kabario ga Yia kezhe la ye fi beo dagan miniubo ga Yia kezhe kuye tinya beo
And We showed Pharaoh all Our Signs but he did reject and refuse,Hakika ma Yi la aya Yi zhi wu Firauna yan baeni uciu yi ganmana u cia navo
He said Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic, O MosesFirauna ci ganGbani wyo bebe ebo wyo la yiyin yano tinoya dagan kin yan yi bo eya-ma-wyo yin Musa
He said Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic ,O MosesFirauna ci ganGbani wyo bebe ebo wyo la yiyin yano tinoya dagan kin yan yi bo eya-ma-wyo yin Musa
 But we can surely produce magic to match thine! So make a tryst between us and thee which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - in a place where both shall have even chances,To hakika yi maa be yao be eyan-mae iriu yin ebo acino a efomusanmaman laa cic tsakani yibo be wyo yin yimaa leu baa to wyotso maaleu baa umau yi danna na -- yin na
 Moses said Your tryst is the Day of the Festival and let the people be assembled when the sun is well up,Musa ci ganEfo na mi lacici ya ye na uga yi efo ninpa Iidi ye yeo zawangizhi maa laa guna yekan kpata be yi-sakagi
 So Pharaoh withdrew He concerted his plan and then came back,Firauna cia zunma zheta ucia tanadi uzhi kpata ku yekan gancin aci dabe banaa la shi yan gun-gun na
Moses said to him Woe to you! Forge not ye a lie against Allah lest He destroy you at once utterly by chastisement the forger must suffer frustration!,Musa ci gana gan Takaici! Ega tswa ganmana ta Soko ma kacana Ugae jin hallaka be azabae hakika ma zandondo nagae tswa ganmana ta Soko na wyuna zun-ya
So they disputed one with another over their affair but they kept their talk secret,Aci gbo mi be dozhi mini alamaria bo acia eza baa zhi swo
 They said These two are certainly expert magicians their object is to drive you out from your land with their magic and to do away with your most cherished institutions,Aci ganHakika za gubaaba nana zhi Musa be Harunae eyan-ma cizhi ayio e wa-wa gan ala ye yea yana tinaya dagan kin-mi yebo be eyan-maa yin acia la eyan wangi-wangi yezhia kua
Therefore concert your plan and then assemble in serried ranks He wins all along today who gains the upper hand,Ebo acino yea tanadiezhi ku yekan ye vie tineyae be safu-safu hakika zana gaade galaba yin-na na gaade elstu
They said O Moses! whether wilt thou that thou throw first or that we be the first to throwAci gan ,Wyoe Musa! Ko wyo ka-yn-ce ko ma YiI la-yca yn-ce be dzo
 He said Nay throw ye first! Then behold their ropes and their rods-so it seemed to him on account of their magic - began to be in lively motion!,UganAa yedea ce be dzo gancin acia egbanazhi to tsukunazhi ce zhizhi acie sana fia eyeo mini eyanmaabo ke wyoegangan ewa nae dazan nao
 So Moses conceived in his mind a sort of fear,Musa cia ya edan-yn wo dan mini yangbanu bo
We said Fear not! for thou hast indeed the upper hand,Yici ganGa sundan ma hakika wyo ga wun zankpeo
 Throw that which is in thy right hand Quickly will it swallow up that which they have faked what they have faked is but a magician´s trick and the magician thrives not no matter where he goes,Wyo mao la yanna dan gwaalo wyo bo nao ceo cici u ga yannazhi a san kpata na ku yin Hakika yannazhi a san kpata na tanadi eyan macizhio eyan-maci maatso guria bandondo na uga lo na
 So the magicians were thrown down to prostration they said We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses,Gancin eyan-maci zhi kpata cia nikin zhi kinbo a daa sujada aci ganYi yia imani jin be Tsoci yan Haruna be Musae
Pharaoh said Believe ye in Him before I give you permission Surely this must be your leader who has taught you magic! be sure I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and I will have you crucified on trunks of palm-trees so shall ye know for certain which of us can give the more severe and the more lasting punishment!,Firauna ci ganYea imani jin beuyin tun mi laa ya ye izinia Hakika wyun ga yinunsa ye na wu ye eyan ma nao Hakika migae egwazhi to bici yezhi ko ya dan dozhi egwa gwalo be bici gwaapiny hakika mima gae fo-sa dan mini cigban dobinao hakika ye tso maa kpe zii mini yi bo na azabau ta gan uma gboka gan nao
 They said Never shall we regard thee as more than the Clear Signs that have come to us or than Him Who created us! so decree whatever thou desirest to decree for thou canst only decree touching the life of this worldAgan,Hakika yi ga wa wyoe a wyo laata eti aya gbangbazhi nazhi be yayi naa Yi zhi kuti be Etsu na ca jin-jin alitta yi nae hukunci ndondo nao gade cia jin eti yibo na ajin hakika hukuncio kpata izhe nana gabo wyoajinu kano
 For us we have believed in our Lord may He forgive us our faults and the magic to which thou didst compel us for Allah is Best and Most AbidingHakika yia imani jin be Tsoci Yi jin ebo ma wyunu fa be yi yin yan bicicin yizhito yan eyan-ma na wyo jin yi kpa a ci da jinna Soko ga ma wun egagba alherio egagbaU gama yi yan danbo dano,
Verily he who comes to his Lord as a sinner at Judgment- for him is Hell therein shall he neither die nor live,Hakika zandondo naga be eba Tsociu uma yi lefi jinci na to hakika jahannama gaajin tabbata yau wyuna tsu gun boa umaade rayia
But such as come to Him as Believers who have worked righteous deeds- for them are ranks exalted-,Zana ma ga be eba Tsociu umayi mumini na lotun wangi-wangizhi na zawuncinzhiade egagba yan daraja nazhi latuna
 Gardens of Eternity beneath which flow rivers they will dwell therein for aye such is the reward of those who purify themselves from evilAljannazhi ayio yan danboda na amaafi bofi tutun yin wuncin gayi egagba yan zana gaali ke lefi lugwa nao,
 We sent an inspiration to Moses Travel by night with My servants and strike a dry path for them through the sea without fear of being overtaken by Pharaoh and without any other fear,Hakika ma Yijin wahayi fi Musa kede A wuzhi mi zhi ku tinya dan ezan yeshio wyo mao la ekoosaoyaa dan mini eduo eko na yi wiwocina Wyo mao ga sundan gan ko Firauna ga ye tso ma ye mae ga sundan kikya gun nuwano ma
 Then Pharaoh pursued them with his forces but the waters completely overwhelmed them and covered them up,Gancin Firauna cia mi tua be ekungunciuzhi nuwan yan edu cia rukpea baenio\
Pharaoh led his people astray instead of leading them aright,Firauna cia jamaa yanuzhi kufi egbino baenio uma la bawu ndondo ya a
 O ye Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy and We made a Covenant with you on the right side of Mount Sinai and We sent down to you Manna and quails,Ya ye Bani Israilazhi! Hakika Yia ye gangwa be egun makiri ye yina ni Yi ma jin ye alkawali yan gungun be yeyin kansanta gwaalo yan pati Turisinaio Yima cin yangici yan manna be salwae be yaye
 Saying Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance but commit no excess therein lest My Wrath should justly descend on you and those on whom descends My Wrath do perish indeed!,E gi dagan mini eyan lilici nazhi Yi la yaye arzikinao ye mae ga gbin iyaka tu dan miniubo ma kacana ewunzhe mi gaa cin ta ye zaeni ndondo nama fushi Mi gaa cin ta na to hakika zawuncinajin hallaka 
But without doubt I am also He that forgives again and again to those who repent believe and do right who- in fine are ready to receive true guidance,Hakika ma Mi Etsu gafara Miyio ya zana ga tuba jin ucia imani jin uci lotun wangi-wangizhi gancin ucia kugikini ta eti ekpa bawuo nao
 When Moses was up on the Mount Allah said What made thee hasten in advance of thy people O Moses,Kiima la wyo ci din-ye cia jamaa yan wyozhi lugwao musa
He replied Behold they are close on my footsteps I hastened to thee O my Lord to please thee,Ugan Ngan atsoa gbami zunma be gbaani mima din-ye din be eba wyoe Tsoci ebo wyoojin yeda be mi yin
Allah said We have tested thy people in thy absence the Samiri has led them astrayUgan ,Hakika Yia jamaa yan wyozhi ma-cin le zunma-wyo bo samiriyu ma wyuna kufi egbino
 So Moses returned to his people in a state of indignation and sorrow He said O my people! did not your Lord make a handsome promise to you Did then the promise seem to you long in coming Or did ye desire that Wrath should descend from your Lord on you and so ye broke your promise to me,Musa ci kezhe dazhin eba jamaa yanuzhi be ewunzhee umaa nyin yangban uci gan Asa Tsoci ye Ujin ye alkawali nayi wangi naa Kashi lokaci naUda yaye na tsa lokpa fi ye yeo Kashi ye wawa gan ewunzhe yan Tsoci ye ulau cinu yaye ugala ye cia le alkawali mi bao
 They said We broke not the promise to thee as far as lay in our power but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the whole people and we threw them into the fire and that was what the Samiri suggested,Acigan Ujin banbayi la yici le alkawali baa amaade ala kara zunubi la ta yi dagan mini kaaya ninpa yan jamaa yan Kibtiyyu zhio Yicia ku ce ya acinga gama Samiriyyu otso ce yan wyun ya mao
Then he brought out of the fire before the people the image of a calf It seemed to low so they said This is your god and the god of Moses but Moses has forgotten!,Ucia nanko gigi na yibe nakanena wa tinya yaa dagan mini enao uma fe ti wu aci gan Nana gayi Tsoci ye yeo to yan Musao amaade Musa a batan
Could they not see that it could not return them a word for answer and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good,Ale ye lea kede nanko gigi sin-sanci wuncin wyune zhegana naa yina umade kagbo yan gwakan eyan gun koma yan lilabe alheri naa yina
Aaron had already before this said to them O my people! ye are being tested in this for verily your Lord is Allah Most Gracious so follow me and obey my command,Hakika ma Haruna ganyaa shidzo batso zhio uci gan Ya ye jamaa yan Mizhi! Hakika a maye ma cinle beuyin kawanyin hakika ma Soko AL-RAHMANU wyun gayi Tsoci ye yeo ebo acino yea emi tu mi ye mae laegba foro mi
They had said We will not abandon this cult but we will devote ourselves to it until Moses returns to us,Agan Yia pan yeshia yia fe jin bauta yau har sai Musao tso ga zhin cibe tsun yi
 Moses said O Aaron! what kept thee back when thou sawest them going wrong,Musa gan Wyo Haruna! Kii kan wyo yo kamina wyo lea yeagbin nao
 From following me Didst thou then disobey my order,Wyoci lami tumi be gan ya mi yina yano Kashi wyo a le foro mi le ba
Aaron replied O son of my mother! Seize me not by my beard nor by the hair of my head! Truly I feared lest thou shouldst say ´Thou has caused a division among the children of Israel and thou didst not respect my word!´,Haruna cigan Ya wyoe egi-nna-mi ga din mi nunkpa yin ma wyo mao ga la gwa sun mi etioma hakika mi fe sundan na wyoa gan-ganwyoa jamaa yan Bani Israila zhin gan kpere-kpere wyo ma lamitu egan miyina na
Moses said What then is thy case O Samiri,Musa cigan Kici mayi eza wyo yio Samiri
He replied I saw what they saw not so I took a handful of dust from the footprint of the Messenger and threw it into the calf thus did my soul suggest to me,Ugan Mile yandoci le ye na tso a leyea na Mici to jikanna dagan bici kinpa yan Tuci jibriluo miciu ce kpe nanko gigio Acinga gama yangbanmi pau nin fi mi yino
Moses said Get thee gone! but thy punishment in this life will be that thou wilt say ´touch me not´ and moreover for a future penalty thou hast a promise that will not fail Now look at thy god of whom thou hast become a devoted worshipper We will certainly melt it in a blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea!,Musa ci gan To fe lo ammade edunfe izheo nakena yanna wyo afe gan na ugayi La mi sa sao mia ye lagwa toa mitso maa la to zandondoa wyo mayi be lokaci na a ceu lebaa na wyo mao cin kuti wyoe na wyo kanta cie wun nao le hakika yi gau danna gancin yi ci gaa ce ya gun eduo baenio
But the god of you all is the One Allah there is no god but He all things He comprehends in His knowledge,HakikaTsoci ye ugayi Soko Etsu na ade Tsoci ndocia sai wyun na kpikpeUma wuna gwo cia yandondo ma kezhe
 Thus do We relate to thee some stories of what happened before for We have sent thee a Message from Our own Presence,Acinga ga Yie gba labari mini labari yan nazhi shidzo na ya wyo yo Hakika ma Yi la sinsantu Alkuranu ya wyoe dagan eba Yibo
If any do turn away therefrom verily they will bear a burden on the Day of judgment,Zaeni ndondo na gau ce ci zunmao na hakika uga lefi nagbota na la Efo Alkiyami
 They will abide in this state and grievous will the burden be to them on that Day-A fi miniubo tutun yin bibi maajin tabbata ya zandondo nagala kara zunubi na,
The Day when the Trumpet will be sounded that Day We shall gather the sinful blear-eyed with terror,Efo na a be efe fi mini kafo na Yici ga lefi jincizhi san fo wuncin eyeazhi cia yi dzukan-yin
 In whispers will they consult each other Yet tarried not longer than ten DaysAcie swo eza ba tsakaniabo be dozhi acie gan gan Hakika ye fedun dan izhe boa sai de yan efo-guwo kawan yin,
We know best what they will say when their leader most eminent in conduct will say Ye tarried not longer than a day!,Hakika Yiga de kpikpe gano yan egan nazhie gan nao kamina zanazhi de yekpa gan miniabo na fe gan gan Hakika ye fedun izhe boa sai de yan foeni
They ask thee concerning the Mountains say My Lord will uproot them and scatter them as dust,Amae gbin wyo gan eti patizhio to gan-gan Tsoci mi gau ban ruku baenio
 He will leave them as plains smooth and level,Gancin uci gau ta cici parae
Nothing crooked or curved wilt thou see in their place,Wyoa le bandoci nagaa kan kotoe na yea wyo maale tutunti ndoci yea
On that Day will they follow the Caller straight no crookedness can they show him all sounds shall humble themselves in the Presence of Allah Most Gracious nothing shalt thou hear but the tramp of their feet as they march,Efo wuncin aga mitu zanae yia lo gungun yekan ba na ade zandondo naa pan ke eko lugwa naa be rezhi kpaata ma gaa ta daa kin ebo dansun Soko AL-RAHMANUI ade yanna wyoawo naa sai de bici nae la dazan na
On that Day shall no intercession avail except for those for whom permission has been granted by Allah Most Gracious and whose word is acceptable to Him,Fo wuncin gwatanajin anfania sai zana Soko AL-RAHMANU ga ya izini na Uci jin yeda yau gaU gan-gan na
 He knows what appears to His creatures as before or after or behind them but they shall not compass it with their knowledge,Soko de kpikpe yan nazhi fi yegboroa bo na to nazhi ke dan zunmaabo naama mau -- ba wo be kpikpe ndondo yina
All faces shall be humbled before Him - the Living the Self-Subsisting Eternal hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity on his back,Fuskazhi kpaata maa gbazhizhi ya Soko Etsu rayi Etsu na gikini gbaugi na Hakika ma zandondo na ga la kara zwalunci na eyan la pa Soko baci na wyuna sunzunya
 But he who works deeds of righteousness and has faith will have no fear of harm nor of any curtailment of what is his due,Zaeni ndondo na ma gae lotun wangi-wangizhi na umayi mumini wangi na to wyuna de dansun yan lefi zandoci naa labe yan wyun naa umaa de dansun laadau naa keu yan naa
Thus have We sent this down - an arabic Qur´an - and explained therein in detail some of the warnings in order that they may fear Allah or that it may cause their remembrance of Him,Acinga ga ma Yicinubeo Alkuranu uyio be zhimi larabcii Yima la misalizhi be fi bo dokun yan ewun nazhi ebo de a sundan Soko ko ma alaafe eza sinsantu ci zhi
High above all is Allah the King the Truth! Be not in haste with the Qur´an before its revelation to thee is completed but say O my Lord! advance me in knowledge,Elatu kpaataajin tabbata ya Etsu na wun mulki gaskiya na wyo mao ga dinye be gbigba Alkuranui tun Yi laa gun wahayizhi mi be ya wyo yaa ma wyo mao feo gan gan Tsoci mi! Be mi kpikpe
We had already beforehand taken the covenant of Adam but he forgot and We found on his part no firm resolve,Hakika ma Yi jin alkawali be Adamui tun shidzo kafi ugi sun-sun yan cigban na ucia alkawali wuncin batan Yima tsunu zana de kagbo yangban naa
 We had already beforehand taken the covenant of Adam but he forgot and We found on his part no firm resolve,Hakika ma Yi jin alkawali be Adamui tun shidzo kafi ugi sun-sun yan cigban na ucia alkawali wuncin batan Yima tsunu zana de kagbo yangban naa
When We said to the angels Prostrate yourselves to Adam they prostrated themselves but not Iblis he refused,Wyo mao pa kamina Yi gan be malaika zhi gan Ejin sujada ya Adamu kpata cia sujada jin saide Iblisu wun cia navo
 Then We said O Adam! verily this is an enemy to thee and thy wife so let him not get you both out of the Garden so that thou art landed in misery,Gancin Yici gan To wyo Adamu! Hakika shetan nana makiri wyoe uyio to ya yinmi wyoe ebo acino ega lugwa ukue dzun tinya dagan mini Aljannao ma kacana egaajin wahala
There is therein enough provision for thee not to go hungry nor to go naked,Hakika wyoa gun madan dan miniuboa wyo maa za ya-vuna
 Nor to suffer from thirst nor from the sun´s heat,Nuwan maa wo wyoe dan miniu boa wyo maa wo banagun boa
But Satan whispered evil to him he said O Adam! shall I lead thee to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays,Shetan cia swo lou yangbano be wasiwaasi uci gan Ya wyoe Adamu! Kashi min-wu-wyo ba lo eba cigban sun-sun yan danbodan be yan mulki naa zoa na
In the result they both ate of the tree and so their nakedness appeared to them they began to sew together for their covering leaves from the Garden thus did Adam disobey his Lord and allow himself to be seduced,Zagubaa baa cia gi dagan mini cigban wuncino yavunazhi cia tula zhizhi yaa acife la fini yan Aljanna zhi kan yi taazhi Adama ma cia le Tsociu ba ucia jin wahala
 But his Lord chose him for His Grace He turned to him and gave him GuidanceGancin Tsoci u ci beu li Uci fa beuyin U ciu wuba,
He said Get ye down both of you- all together from the Garden with enmity one to another but if as is sure there comes to you Guidance from Me whosoever follows My Guidance will not lose his way nor fall into misery,Ugan E cin dagan miniubo za gubaa bae sashiezhi afe na sashi vo Ujin wo ma bawu ndoci wuna fe be yaye dagan eba Mibo to zana ga mitu bawu Mi na to hakika wyuna gbina umaajin wahalaa
 But whosoever turns away from My Message verily for him is a life narrowed down and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment,Zae ni ndondo nama ga zunma zheta pipa Mina hakika wyuna le izhe pinpinci Yima sanusan Efo Alkiyamii yebonci
 He will say O my Lord! why hast Thou raised me up blind while I had sight beforeUgan Tsoci! Kijin wyocia mi san yebonci yinnao alaalima mia fe zanae lebaye nao,
Allah will say Thus didst Thou when Our Signs came unto thee disregard them so wilt thou this day be disregarded,Ugan Acinga ga aya Yizhi fe be ya wyoe izhe bo wyo cia batano acinga ga aaba wyotso tan yin-nao
 And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes not in the Signs of his Lord and the Penalty of the Hereafter is far more grievous and more enduring,Acinga gama Yie la egagba ya zandondo naga rayuwau nyin-ya umajin imani be aya Tsoci u zhi yina nao Azaba yan Alkiyami ma tan gan umaa danbo gan
Is it not a warning to such men to call to mind how many generations before them We destroyed in whose haunts they now move Verily in this are Signs for men endued with understanding,Kashi to gbani ulaa latu ya aa kede Yijin alummazhi dokun nazhi fe dazan fi ezhia zhiona hallaka naa Hakika mini wuncino ayazhi danbo ya zanazhi gayi eza hankali zhi na
Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord their punishment must necessarily have come but there is a Term appointed for respiteKaganujin ebo egan ndoci naashidzo dan eba Tsoci wyo boani naa be iyaaka na yi bibaci naa daa ugaazhe tiile na Yigaajin azabaa ni na,
Therefore be patient with what they say and celebrate constantly the praises of thy Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting yea celebrate them for part of the hours of the night and at the sides of the day that thou mayest have spiritual joy,Ebo acino a hakuri jin be iri egan nazhi agae gan na wyo mao feo li Tsoci wyoe be jin jin yeboe yau kafi igidiu lau tinuya na be shidzo kafi igidiu lo mina to mini yeshio to kansan yan igidio u jin wo Sokoa ga wo be yanna wyoa jin yeda be yin-nae
Nor strain thine eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to parties of them the splendour of the life of this world through which We test them but the provision of thy Lord is better and more enduring,Wyo mao ga la eye wyo zhi fe cin yannazhi Yi la yaa yan eman-wo izhe le na ma ninpa uyio yan izhe kawanyin ebo Yii manaa ciny-le dan miniubo Arziki yan Tsoci wyo ma wun gade alheri gano wunga mayi yan danbo dano
Enjoin prayer on thy people and be constant therein We ask thee not to provide sustenance We provide it for thee But the fruit of the Hereafter is for righteousness,Wyo mao jin iyaliozhi foro be sallah jin-y wyo mao la hakurio jin eti wuncino Ujin arziki ku ye kan Yigaa gbin wyoe esuna hakika Yi gaa ya wyoe arzikio Zoba wangi ma gaajin tabbata ya zana gae sundan Soko na
 They say Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord Has not a Clear Sign come to them of all that was in the former Books of revelation ,Acigan Kiijin uci la aya ndoci be yayi dagan eba Tsociu boa yino Ngba bayani nazhi fi Litafi mafari zhiona ube ya aa
And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this they would have said Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent us a messenger we should certainly have followed Thy Signs before we were humbled and put to shame,Daaci gan Yi jina hallaka jin shidzo be dzo daa a gangan Tsoci yi ki la wyoci tun Tuci fi yi yia yano ngan da yi ga mi tuu shidzo kaafi yi le egba be zunyesun-y-ye na

" Closer and closer to mankind comes their Reckoning yet they heed not and they turn away	 Never comes aught to them of a renewed Message from their Lord but they listen to it as in jest-Alkuranu Litafi cincinci uyio dagan eba Soko nayi Etsu rahma nan nan yi Etsu yegun nan",
Their hearts toying as with trifles The wrong-doers conceal their private counsels saying Is this one more than a man like yourselves Will ye go to witchcraft with your eyes openLitafi Alkuranu yio na a ayauzhi kpe ye kakayin na Alkuranu na yi be zhimi Larabcii na ebo za nazhi gayi eza kpikpe zhi na,
Say My Lord knoweth every word spoken in the heavens and on earth He is the One that heareth and knoweth all things,Wune ya labari yangban fa U mae kezhe nan-wun Ekundondo zawangizhi cia zunma zheta acie wo gana
Nay they say these are medleys of dream! - Nay He forged it! - Nay He is but a poet! Let him then bring us a Sign like the ones that were sent to Prophets of old!,Aci gan Yangban yizhi fi evo kpikpecio ebo acino yie wo yannan ye yi yi etiubo naa to tukpa yizhi otso a tsu yekan ndoci ma dan tsakani yibo be wyo yin Ebo acino felo tuneti adini wyo bo akika yitso maa fe lo yan yi ma

Before thee also the messengers We sent were but men to whom We granted inspiration If ye realise this not ask of those who possess the Message,Za nanzhie wa zakka dukiyaazhia nan a mae kezhe jin kafirinci be alamari efo zobae na
Nor did We give them bodies that ate no food nor were they exempt from deathAkika za nanzhia imani jin nan acie lotun wangizhi nan aade lada nande iyakaa na,
In the end We fulfilled to them Our Promise and We saved them and those whom We pleased but We destroyed those who transgressed beyond boundsGan gan Ngba ye ye jin kafirinci be Etsu nan jin alitta yan kin dan mini efo gubao nan Ye cie la yan docizhi pau baci be Etsu wuncin ga yi Tsoci nanekpa alittazhi kpata nao,

 Flee not but return to the good things of this life which were given you and to your homes in order that ye may be called to account,A ga zunma zheta gan yaa gan Miejine gangba be azaba yan kabara hallaka iri kabara hallaka nan de jamaa yan Aduzhi to Samuduzhi nan

Nay We hurl the Truth against falsehood and it knocks out its brain and behold falsehood doth perish! Ah! woe be to you for the false things ye ascribe to UsYicia Muminizhi nazhie tswa Soko na wa dzun,
 To Him belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth Even those who are in His very Presence are not too proud to serve Him nor are they ever weary of His service,Efo nan aku makiri Soko zhi yekan lo enan na fo wuncin afe nyana nyan da fi azabao
They celebrate His praises night and day nor do they ever flag or intermitLokaci nan aga tun eba enan na tukpaazhi to eyeazhi to epa yan nankan kpaceazhi a feya eri etiabo be iri etun nanzhiy a fe lo nan,
 Or have they taken for worship gods from the earth who can raise the dead,Acia gan be epa yan nakan kpaceazhiy gan Kiy la yecie ya ri eti yi bo Aci gan Soko nae ya yandondo iko cie gangan nan u ga ya yi iko ci gangano wun ga majin alitta ye tun dagan caba bo ebau ga ma yea kezhe lo

He cannot be questioned for His acts but they will be questioned for theirs,Yekpa dede wuncin nan ye fe kpa be Tsoci ye yin nan u ga jin ye hallakao Ye cia fe dan mini za nanzhi a jin asara nan
 Or have they taken for worship other gods besides him Say Bring your convincing proof this is the Message of those with me and the Message of those before me But most of them know not the Truth and so turn away,A ga ankuri jin enan tsa yi ezhe kebaao ka ama ga ta uzuri a dan mini za nanzhiy a -- uzuria nan boa

And they say Allah Most Gracious has begotten offspring Glory to Him! they are but servants raised to honourKafirizhi ci gan Ega shi tukpa ya Alkuranu nan nan maefe gan gan eti kperezhi etiubo ebo ye debae lae de zankpe,
They speak not before He speaks and they act in all things by His Command,Wallahi Yia jin kafirizhi azaba nan tan sarauyin nan Yi maa gaagba be azaba nan bi ye gan etun nanzhi a fe lo nan
He knows what is before them and what is behind them and they offer no intercession except for those who are acceptable and they stand in awe and reverence of His Glory,Wuncin ga yi egagba yan makiri Soko zhio enan gabo a fio emi naa fi tutuyin nan wuncin ga yi egagba yan emi nan a fe gbo be aya yi zhi-y-nao

Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit of creation before we clove them asunder We made from water every living thing Will they not then believe,Akika za nanzhiy ga gan gan Soko ga yi Tsoci yi yio na aci kezhea kugikini be etuny nan malaikazhia fecin be ebaa be taimako Sokoe kede ga sundan ma ye mae ga nyin yangban ma Ye mae fe fa yangban be gingandan Aljannae nan afe la jin ye alkawali nan

And We have made the heavens as a canopy well guarded yet do they turn away from the Signs which these things point to!Eyan cincinci a yio nan fe be dagan eba Soko nan Soko nan yi Etsu gafara nan nan yi Etsu yegun nan,

 When the Unbelievers see thee they treat thee not except with ridicule Is this they say the one who talks of your gods and they blaspheme at the mention of Allah Most Gracious!,Kami ndondo nan wyo ga wo sharya fu yan shaitan nan wa tswitswa be Sokoe Akika Soko ga yi Etsu nae wo gan U ma de kpikpe yandondo nao
 They say When will this promise come to pass if ye are telling the truth,Ama ga gbotika Malaika nanzhiy dan eba Tsoci wyo bo nan e li Soko tsatsa yin to yeshi to igidi a mae wo eboa
Man is a creature of haste soon enough will I show you My Signs then ye will not ask Me to hasten them!,U dan mini zankpe Soko yeshi to batin to igidi to etswa ebo acino ega fe lo sujada ya igidi ko etswa ma E fe lo sujada ya Soko Etsu nan jin alitta nan wunayi Soko ga ye wun wun yan gaskiyao nan

Mocked were many messenger before thee But their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked,Akika za nanzhiy ajin kafirinci be Alkuranuy kamina u be nana gaa ebi gi Akika ma Litafi uyio nan de zankpe nan
 Say Who can keep you safe by night and by day from the Wrath of Allah Most Gracious Yet they turn away from the mention of their Lord,Ganmanan wune be ba wuna ko dagan yegboro ko ma zunmau boa Litafi cincinci uyio dagan eba Etsu hikimao Etsu nan zandondo ejin yebo ya nan

 We shall set up scales of justice for the Day of Judgment so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least and if there be no more than the weight of a mustard seed We will bring it to account and enough are We to take account,Ezhe keba yan kpikpe yan lokaci alkiyami Udan be Sokoe to yangici sun-sun nanzhie tinya dagan gberea bo nan to ewan nan ynzagie la nan kpikpea dan be Sokoe U maa ma gia sai de be kpikpeu yin Efo nan aga yia nan a gbina gan gan Babo za nanzhi ye la pa Mi baci nan dano Acia gangan Yi de tamiy ade zando mini yibo naa ya eri wo naa

 In the past We granted to Moses and Aaron the criterion for judgment and a Light and a Message for those who would do right-,Yan nanzhi afe wun shidzo nan ci ga gbina yeo atso ciga gaskiya ya ke ade bandoa gangwa loa nan
Those who fear their Lord in their most secret thoughts and who hold the Hour of Judgment in awe,Zawangi wune kpebo be biba aduwa alheri zhi yina ammaa eyan dede gaa tswanu wunajin wune la kauna ba be Sokoe wuncin ma gyea

We bestowed aforetime on Abraham his rectitude of conduct and well were We acquainted with him,Yima ga niima la twarya ya zawangi wine la zunma zheta uciga kansan pan ke etun Soko lugwa kami nan eyan dede gaa tswanu nan u gaa fe za nae ba aduwa nan dokun nan
 Behold! he said to his father and his people What are these images to which ye are so assiduously devoted,Gan gan Ngba wuna yi dagan eba Soko bo Alkuranu fe beo gancin yecia kafirinci jin beu yin ngba ziy ga gbin gan za nan dan mini cice leba nan tsoa kpe ya nao

 He said Indeed ye have been in manifest error - ye and your fathers,Akika a fi mini kelo kezhino eti gun guna bo be Tsocia yin akika Sokoa yandondo makezhe be kpikpeu yin 
They said Have you brought us the Truth or are you one of those who jest,Agan Gaskiya ga wyo ma labe ya yi-yio kashi wyode edzodzo dzo be yi yin
 He said Nay your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth He Who created them from nothing and I am a witness to this Truth,Ugan Aa Tsociye de uga yi Tsoci yan sanmazhi to kinyino na jin alitaa na mimaafe ta eti wuncino dan mini erijincizhio
And by Allah I have a plan for your idols - after ye go away and turn your backs,Mima zhi kuti be Sokoe miajin yan be kutiezhi baaci na ye gaasa jin cia zunma zheta na
 So he broke them to pieces all but the biggest of them that they might turn and address themselves to it,Ucia sa tukun-tukun sai de natso yi wanciko tso na wyunu lugwa ko aa zhin bau be gbinu gan
They said Who has done this to our gods He must indeed be some man of impiety!,Agan Hakika zandondo naga jinaninga be kuti yizhi na wyunafe dan mini azwalumizhio
 They said We heard a youth talk of them He is called Abraham,Agan Yiwo gbarufu ndoci danbo wyunajin ufe gia toko e yiu gan Ibrahimu
They said Then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may bear witness,Agan To eda laube zandondou le wyunu ye ebo ma aajin ri
 They said Art thou the one that did this with our gods O Abraham,Agan Ngba wyo gajin acinga be kuti yizhi yino Ibrahima
 He said Nay this was done by - this is their biggest one! ask them if they can speak intelligently!,Ugan Aa nunsaa nana tsa jin acin beayino ye mae gbinagan agae gan-gan na
 So they turned to themselves and said Surely ye are the ones in the wrong!,Aci dazhin cife tagwa tun dozhi acigan Hakika de ye tso tsa yi azwalumizhio
 Then were they confounded with shame they said Thou knowest full well that these idols do not speak!,Acia etiazhi ya zhin kin aciganAmaa ngan wyotso kpe ke kuti nanazhie gan gana na
 Abraham said Do ye then worship besides Allah things that can neither be of any good to you nor do you harmUgan ,To gbani yeafe jin bauta ya yandoci najin Sokoa na nama jin ye anfani woa uma kangwa egun yaye woa na
Fie upon you and upon the things that ye worship besides Allah! Have ye no sense,Tir-jam be alamari yeyin to be yannazhi ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa na Kii jin ye cie lotun be hankali yina yino
 Fie upon you and upon the things that ye worship besides Allah! Have ye no sense,Tir-jam be alamari yeyin to be yannazhi ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa na Kii jin ye cie lotun be hankali yina yino
They said Burn him and protect your gods If ye do anything at all!,AganYiu ce gun nao ye mae jin kutiezhi taimako ye gaajin jin wo na
 We said O Fire! be thou cool and a means of safety for Abraham!,Yici gan Ya wyoe ena afe yeko be aminci ta eti Ibrahimao
Then they sought a stratagem against him but We made them the ones that lost most!,Acia kpa sarauyin naajin tanadi dede beuyin na Yicia tso laafe eza hasarazhi
But We delivered him and his nephew Lut and directed them to the land which We have blessed for the nations,Yiciuy gangwa to wyin to Annabi Lutu Yicia kudaa kin nayi la albarka dan ya alittazhi kpaata na kin yan Falastinu
And We bestowed on him Isaac and as an additional gift a grandson Jacob and We made righteous men of every one of them,Yici twaurya be Ishaqae to Yakubu nayi yagiu na Kpatama Yia laazhe za guru zhi
And We made them leaders guiding men by Our Command and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds to establish regular prayers and to practise regular charity and they constantly served Us and Us only,Yicia la fe edzoshicizhi nazhie wu za zhi ba be foro Yi yin na Yima jin wahayi yaa gan afea lotun alheri zhi to salla kugikini to zakka wa amaafe zanazhie jin bauta yayi na
And We made them leaders guiding men by Our Command and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds to establish regular prayers and to practise regular charity and they constantly served Us and Us only,Yicia la fe edzoshicizhi nazhie wu za zhi ba be foro Yi yin na Yima jin wahayi yaa gan afea lotun alheri zhi to salla kugikini to zakka wa amaafe zanazhie jin bauta yayi na
And to Lut too We gave Judgment and Knowledge and We saved him from the town which practised abominations truly they were a people given to Evil a rebellious people,Annabi Lutu ma Yi yau hukunci be kpikpe Yi ciu wadzun dagan kin wuncin na jamaa yanuzhi e jin yan dedezhi na Hakika a zawuncinzhi aafe eza dede zhi fasikizhi
And We admitted him to Our Mercy for he was one of the Righteous,Yiciu laa gandan mini yegun Yibo hakika wyuna fedan mini za guru zhio
 Remember Noah when he cried to Us aforetime We listened to his prayer and delivered him and his family from great distress,Wyo mao pa kamina Nuhu fe yi Tsociu ye shidzo batsozhio na Yicia aduwau gwo Yiciu gangwa to iyaliuzhi dagan yangban-nyin na wancin nao
We helped him against people who rejected Our Signs truly they were a people given to Evil so We drowned them in the Flood all together,Yici jinu taimako ta eti jamaa nazhia aya Yizhi yi ganmana na Hakika eza dedezhi ayio Yicia jin hallaka fi eduo baenio
 And remember David and Solomon when they gave judgment in the matter of the field into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night We did witness their judgment,Wyo mao pa  kamina Annabi Dauda to Sulaimanu fe jin hukunci ndoci eti yangici latio na kamina dabba yan zandoci zhi da gia yangici lati be yeshi na Hakika Yima fe jin ri yan iri hukunci naafe jin na
 To Solomon We inspired the right understanding of the matter to each of them We gave Judgment and Knowledge it was Our power that made the hills and the birds celebrate Our praises with David it was We Who did all these things,Yicia fahimta hukunci wuncin laa ya Sulaymanu kpaataa ma Yi yaa hukunci annabci be ilimi-y Yicia patizhi to elugizhi laajin foro ya Dawuda e jin tasbihu lili Soko ganni beu yin Yi maafe zanazhi jin acin jin wo na
 It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit to guard you from each other´s violence will ye then be grateful,Yici wuu sanaa yan tufuwa ndoci na gaafe yekan yaye dan lokaci ekuno naYe gaafe zanazhie jin yebo naa
It was Our power that made the violent unruly wind flow tamely for Solomon to his order to the land which We had blessed for We do know all things,Sulaymanu ma Yia efe jin foro yau namae ti be kagboe na wunajin ufe bici be forouyin lo kin yan Falastinu na Yi la albarka dan na Yima yibe kpikpe yandondoe
 And of the evil ones were some who dived for him and did other work besides and it was We Who guarded them,Ama de dan mini jannuzhio nazhie da kya dan mini nuwano acie ku aluului tinya yau na Amae lotun ndocizhi zunma wuncino be ke ebatuzhi na Yimaafe za nazhie tswaa na
And remember Job when He cried to his Lord Truly distress has seized me but Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful,To-Ayyuba kamina uyi Tsoci u ye na uci gan Hakika eguna tso mi wyo ga mayi Etsu yegun kpaatao
And remember Job when He cried to his Lord Truly distress has seized me but Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful,To-Ayyuba kamina uyi Tsoci u ye na uci gan Hakika eguna tso mi wyo ga mayi Etsu yegun kpaatao
So We listened to him We removed the distress that was on him and We restored his people to him and doubled their number- as a Grace from Ourselves and a thing for commemoration for all who serve Us,To Yicia aduwau gwe Yicia egun na dan beuyin na la keyabo yau Yici yau iyali woro dozhin yan paayin zhi be iri ndocizhi pama beayin be ke yagizhi na wuncin mayi yegun dagan eba Yibo umayi sinsantu ya zanazhie jin bauta ya Soko kpaata na
And remember Isma´il Idris and Zul-kifl all men of constancy and patience,To Ismaila to Idreesu to Zul-kifli ndondoa wyunafe dan mini zanazhie jin hakuri nao
 We admitted them to Our mercy for they were of the righteous ones,Yicia la gandan mini yegun Yibo Hakika afe dan mini za guruzhio
 And remember Zun-nun when he departed in wrath He imagined that We had no power over him! But he cried through the deptHs of darkness There is no god but thou glory to thee I was indeed wrong!,To Zan Nuni Annabi Yunusa kamina u wan zan eti ewunzheo na uci fe kpaye gan Yi yi alamari ku yau woa uci yi Soko ye dan mini bazhikozhio ganAde Tsoci ndocia sai de wyoe Soko lili kpaata maajin tabbata ya wyoe hakika mia fe dan mini azwalumizhio be acin na mi jin nae
So We listened to him and delivered him from distress and thus do We deliver those who have faith,Yicia aduwa u gwo Yi ciu wadzun dagan yangban-nyio acinga gama Yiajin-yi a muminizhi dzuno
And remember Zakariya when he cried to his Lord O my Lord! leave me not without offspring though thou art the best of inheritors,Wyo mao pa  Zakariyau kamina uyi Tsoci u ye ci ganTsoci mi! Ga lumigwa gbangi mide egia ma wyo gama gan egun gicizhi kpaatao
 So We listened to him and We granted him Yahya We cured his wife´s Barrenness for him These three were ever quick in emulation in good works they used to call on Us with love and reverence and humble themselves before Us,Yici gwo aduwau Yicia yinminu tadzu yau hakika aafe zanazhie dinye dan jin jin alherizhio na amaajin afe ba Yi yan be evunbae gannibe dansui amaafe zanazhie da ti cici ya Yi na
And remember her who guarded her chastity We breathed into her of Our spirit and We made her and her son a sign for all peoples,To yinzagi naa tswitswa laadan kafaubo na Yici be efe rayi fiu dagan mini Ruhi Yibo na Yici ulaafe to egiu egwa-wu yan zankpe Soko ya alittazhi kpata
Verily this brotherhood of yours is a single brotherhood and I am your Lord and Cherisher therefore serve Me and no other,Hakika alumma ye nana alumma nini uyio Miga ma yi Tsoci yeyeo ebo acino e jin bauta ya Mi
But later generations cut off their affair of unity one from another yet will they all return to Us,Gancin a cia alamarizhi sa kpere-kpere tsakaniabo be dozhi Kpaataama eba Yi ga a kezhe zhino
 Whoever works any act of righteousness and has faith- His endeavour will not be rejected We shall record it in his favour,Zandondo naga lotun wangizhi na alaali umayi mumini na titayakpe ndondo danbo ya etun wyuna hakika ma Yigau ka cici yau
But there is a ban on any population which We have destroyed that they shall not return,Haramu umayio ya alumma ndondo na Yi gaujin hallaka na na wyuna kezhe dazhin izhe be nao
 Until the Gog and Magog people are let through their barrier and they swiftly swarm from every hill,Har da kamina agaa eko ya Yajuju to Majuju nao a maa fe kpankpan zhin dagan pati ndondo
Then will the true promise draw nigh of fulfilment then behold! the eyes of the Unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror Ah! Woe to us! we were indeed heedless of this nay we truly did wrong!,Alkawali yan gaskiya maatso ba gancin eye yan kafirizhi ci gaa gbagba acia fe gan ganKasa yi re!

Verily ye unbelievers and the false gods that ye worship besides Allah are but fuel for Hell! to it will ye surely come!,Acia gana gan Hakika to ye to yannazhi ye jin bauta ya na kaaya yan jahannama ye yio ye maa kpankpan da tsunu
If these had been gods they would not have got there! but each one will abide therein,Daaci gan kuti nana zhi Tsoci ayio da aakpan da fi boa Kpaataa ma bagabo afi tutun yino
There sobbing will be their lot nor will they there hear aught else,Acia fe yi kabara ndoci fi miniubo miniubo ma aa wo bere yandondoa
 Those for whom the good record from Us has gone before will be removed far therefrom,Hakika zanazhi boloboloa shidzo yaa dan nko Yibo na to zawuncinzhi agaa la kpe ya be ena wuncin-y
 Not the slightest sound will they hear of Hell what their souls desired in that will they dwell,Aa wo san-san-wuna ama gaafe fi mini yannazhi yangbanazhi gae de shahawau na tutunyin
The Great Terror will bring them no grief but the angels will meet them with mutual greetings This is your Day- the Day that ye were promised,Edo wanciko tso wuna toa yangban gwaa malaika rahamazhi maafe da guna kede Yinna ga yi efo ye na Soko fe jin ye alkawali nao
 The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books completed- even as We produced the first creation so shall We produce a new one a promise We have undertaken truly shall We fulfil it,Fo wuncin Yiga sanma fan kendoe eyankaci wyunajin fan litafizhi na Kendoe ma Yijin alitta yan mafari na Yigau ye lazhin be alkawali uyio na Yi la na Hakika ma acinga yia jino
Before this We wrote in the Psalms after the Message given to Moses My servants the righteous shall inherit the earth,Hakika ma Yika dan mini Litafi cincincizhio ke Zabura na baci na Yikau dan litafi sinsantuo na LAUHIL-MAHFUZ kede kin nana wuzhi guru Mi zhi gau gi gun na
Verily in this Qur´an is a Message for people who would truly worship Allah,Hakika ma mini Alkuranu nanao kunkunke yan iyaka danbo ya zanazhi gaejin bauta ya Soko naSurah We sent thee not but as a Mercy for all creaturesYima tun wyo tun tuna sai de ebo wyo laofe yeguno ya alitazhi kpata
 Say What has come to me by inspiration is that your Allah is One Allah will ye therefore bow to His Will in IslamGan yaa gan ,Hakika e jin wahayi ya mi kede Tsoci ye Tsoci nini kete uyio na Kashi ye ga kpatsun ta ya foro wyuna
 But if they turn back Say I have proclaimed the Message to you all alike and in truth but I know not whether that which ye are promised is near or far,To ama ga zunma zheta gan yaa gan Midea emiya yaye baeni boani Mima kpea ko yanna Sokoe la jine alkawali na wuna tsobo koma wuna kpeyaa
But if they turn back Say I have proclaimed the Message to you all alike and in truth but I know not whether that which ye are promised is near or far,To ama ga zunma zheta gan yaa gan Midea emiya yaye baeni boani Mima kpea ko yanna Sokoe la jine alkawali na wuna tsobo koma wuna kpeyaa
It is He Who knows what is open in speech and what ye hide in your hearts,Hakika wyuntso Soko de kpikpe yan yannazhi tula mini egano na uma de kpikpe yan-nazhi ye swo na

Say O my Lord! judge Thou in truth!

 O mankind! fear your Lord! for the convulsion of the Hour of Judgment will be a thing terrible!,Ya ye zawangizhi! E sundan Tsocie ye mae tswau Hakika dudu be kun-kun yan Alkiyami alamari uyio na gbota na
The Day ye shall see it every mother giving suck shall forget her suckling-babe and every pregnant female shall drop her load unformed thou shalt see mankind as in a drunken riot yet not drunk but dreadful will be the Wrath of Allah,Fona ye gaa le uye na ynzagi ndondo nae ya gi ebe ye na ugaa dzun gan yanna wyune ya be ye nao ewan deci ndondo ma ga yan na dan ewanubo na ma-ci ci ka wunayi ewan lokaci ninio wyo maale zawangi zhi ye a pe alaalima ujin egye peaa amaaade azaaba Soko tsa gbotao

 About the Evil One it is decreed that whoever turns to him for friendship him will he lead astray and he will guide him to the Penalty of the Fire,Aa kpa ya shetan kede zandondo naga da gbau dzana to hakika sai ugau la dan gbino gancin ucia dinugwa lo azaba yan ena saeeru
O mankind! if ye have a doubt about the Resurrection consider that We created you out of dust then out of sperm then out of a leech-like clot then out of a morsel of flesh partly formed and partly unformed in order that We may manifest our power to you and We cause whom We will to rest in the wombs for an appointed term then do We bring you out as babes then foster you that ye may reach your age of full strength and some of you are called to die and some are sent back to the feeblest old age so that they know nothing after having known much and further thou seest the earth barren and lifeless but when We pour down rain on it it is stirred to life it swells and it puts forth every kind of beautiful growth in pairs,Ya ye zawangizhi!

This is so because Allah is the Reality it is He Who gives life to the dead and it is He Who has power over all things,Wuncin mayi ebona hakika Soko ga yi gaskiyao na hakikama wyun gae dan eyan tsutsuci rayio hakikama Etsu Uyio na de iiko ta eti yandondo na
And verily the Hour will come there can be no doubt about it or about the fact that Allah will raise up all who are in the graves,Hakika ma Alkiyami yan naadabe na uyio kelo-kezhin ndondo danboa hakikama Soko ga zanazhi fi kagario na la nakin
Yet there is among men such a one as disputes about Allah without Knowledge without Guidance and without a Book of Enlightenment-,Amade dan mini zawangizhio zanaajin ufe gbomi dan alamari Soko umayi be kpikpe ko bawu ko be litafi yan bayani yina na
Disdainfully bending his side in order to lead men astray from the Path of Allah for him there is disgrace in this life and on the Day of Judgment We shall make him taste the Penalty of burning Fire,Ucia jin wyuela kansanu pan ebode ula zawangizhi upanuke eko Sokoulugwa Zunyesun gaajin tabbata yau izhe nanao Yimaa yau azaba pipoci fin efo Alkiyamiy
 It will be said This is because of the deeds which thy hands sent forth for verily Allah is not unjust to His servants,Wuncin mayi ebo etun dede na egwa wyo tso zhi lo shidzo nao Hakika Soko ma ujin Etsu nae jin wuzhiUzhi zwalunci naa
There are among men some who serve Allah as it were on the verge if good befalls them they are therewith well content but if a trial comes to them they turn on their faces they lose both this world and the Hereafter that is loss for all to see!,Amade dan mini zawangizhio zanaajin ufe jin bauta ya Soko kapa-kapa gio na Kamina alheri gaa deu na wyuna cin yangban-ta beuyin kamina ma fitina ndoci gadeu na wyuna fuskau zhekpe cia fe jin kafirinci Zannaajin asara izhe to Alkiyami Wuncin ga mayi asara yan gbangbao
 They call on such deities besides Allah as can neither hurt nor profit them that is straying far indeed from the Way!,Ucia fe da jin bauta ya yandoci najin Sokoa na naala egun tsou woa na uma la eyan anfani ndoci yau woana Wuncin gayi egbin naa kpe ya nao
Perhaps they call on one whose hurt is nearer than his profit evil indeed is the patron and evil the companion or help!,Wyune da jin bauta ya za na egunu utsoba gan anfaniu na hakika ndakata nana wuna biye eynmanci nana maa biye
Verily Allah will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds to Gardens beneath which rivers flow for Allah carries out all that He plans,Hakika Soko ga zanazhia imani jin acie lotun wangi-wangizhi na laa gandan Aljannazhio-nazhi nuwan zhieje fi takoabo na Hakika Sokoajin ujin yanna ga bau na
If any think that Allah will not help him His Messenger in this world and the Hereafter let him stretch out a rope to the ceiling and cut himself off then let him see whether his plan will remove that which enrages him!,Zaeni ndondo nagae jin zatto gan Soko ajin Annabiu taimako izhe to eku boa na to wyunula egbanulo sanma gancin uciu la wunu ba uciu cinu le ko tanadiu nama ga takaiciu li yau
Thus have We sent down Clear Signs and verily Allah doth guide whom He will!,Acinga ga Yicin Alkuranu beo ayazhi ayio nazhiyi gbangba na hakika ma Soko ajin Ula zana gaba Una ke eko gboro
Those who believe in the Qur´an those who follow the Jewish scriptures and the Sabians Christians Magians and Polytheists- Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment for Allah is witness of all things,Hakika zanazhia imani jin na to Yahuduzhi to Sabiuzhi to zanazhi la yan pa Soko baci na hakika Soko ga hukunci jin tsakaniabo be dozhi efo Alkiyamiy Hakika Sokoe jin ri eti yandondo
Seest thou not that to Allah bow down in worship all things that are in the heavens and on earth- the sun the moon the stars the hills the trees the animals and a great number among mankind But a great number are also such as are fit for Punishment and such as Allah shall disgrace- None can raise to honour for Allah carries out all that He wills,Kashi wyo le ye gan hakika Soko yannazhi fi samazhio kpatana to nazhi fi kinbo na e jin sujada jin ya wyuna acinga to igidi to etswa to tswangizhi to patizhi to cigban to dabbazhi to ekun dondo mini zawangizhio ekundondoa ma azaba wunajin tabbata ta etiabo to zandondo na Soko gaa gba na ade zandondo naala cinwan yau wo naa Hakika Sokoa jin ujin yan na ga bau na
 These two antagonists dispute with each other about their Lord But those who deny their Lord- for them will be cut out a garment of Fire over their heads will be poured out boiling water,Za gubaaba na nazhi muminizhi to kafirizhi husumajinci zhi ayio e jin husuma jin eti alamari Tsociabo zanazhi maajin kafirinci na aga tufuwazhi ba yaa dagan enao acia fe to nuwan yipa sisaci kpea dagan titaabo
 With it will be scalded what is within their bodies as well as their skins,Acia fe zun yannazhi fi gbako azhiona be nuwan sisaci wunciny to ekpaazhi
 In addition there will be maces of iron to punish them,Amaa fe gibi be bulala yan yankpazhi
Every time they wish to get away therefrom from anguish they will be forced back therein and it will be said Taste ye the Penalty of Burning!,Kandondo na agaa kpa tintinya dagan mini enao ebo yangban-ayinona agaa yan da fibo be acia fe yaa azaba na wona nafin
Allah will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds to Gardens beneath which rivers flow they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments there will be of silk,Hakika Soko ga zanazhia imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi na laa gandan Aljannazhio nazhi nuwan zhie je fi takoabo na acia fe paanin fibo be kaaya zinariyazhi be aluuluizhi tufuwaazhi ma miniubo ugayi alharirio
For they have been guided in this life to the purest of speeches they have been guided to the Path of Him Who is Worthy of all Praise,Acia wuba lo gingan yan egan nazhi yi wangizhina ama wuaba lo eko Soko nayi Etsu yebo na
As to those who have rejected Allah and would keep back men from the Way of Allah and from the Sacred Mosque which We have made open to all men - equal is the dweller there and the visitor from the country - and any whose purpose therein is profanity or wrong-doing - them will We cause to taste of a most Grievous Penalty,Hakika zanazhia jin kafirinci na acie kan zawangi eko Soko-yn-da na acie kan ezan lo masallaci Harami na Yi la shishi ya zawangizhi baenio to zana shibo shi na to zanae be dagan ezhi ndocio na Zandondo na ma ga kpa lulo baaga be gbingbintuI be zwalunci ina Yia yau azaba na tan na fin
Behold! We gave the site to Abraham of the Sacred House saying Associate not anything in worship with Me and sanctify My House for those who compass it round or stand up or bow or prostrate themselves therein in prayer,Wyo mao pa lokaci na Yila danna yan kata kaaba wu Ibrahima na Yi ci ganu ganWyo mao ga la yandondo pa mi baci ma wyo mao la kata Mi yino tadzuo ya za nazhia be jin tawaafi na to zanazhie fedun gun bo na to ya zanazhie jin rukuu acie jin sujada na
 And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men they will come to thee on foot and mounted on every kind of camel lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways,Wyo mao yamio ya zawangizhi eti jin jin yan Hajio aafe be be ezan- bicizhiy amaabe ta eti eyantuciazhi iri ndondoe aafe tinya be dagan kin nazhi shiko ama lokpa sarauyin nao
 That they may witness the benefits provided for them and celebrate the name of Allah through the Days appointed over the cattle which He has provided for them for sacrifice then eat ye thereof and feed the distressed ones in want,Eboade baajin ri yan eyan anfaniazhi amaatun sunna Sokoa ye dan mini efo nazhi yi kpikpeci zhi nao eti arziki nazhi Ula yaa dagan mini dabba yan eman-wo zhiona Efe gi dagan miniabo ye mae ya zana zhi dan bayibaonae gi to talakazhi
 Then let them complete the rites prescribed for them perform their vows and again circumambulate the Ancient House,Acia la etun ibadazhia gunmi be edzuta yan shikanazhi ke eti wan na amaala alkawaliazhi she yan hadaya be layya jin-y amaajin Tawaafi yan kata na yi sisaci lilici na
 Such is the Pilgrimage whoever honours the sacred rites of Allah for him it is good in the Sight of his Lord Lawful to you for food in Pilgrimage are cattle except those mentioned to you as exception but shun the abomination of idols and shun the word that is false-,Wuncin zhi dano na Zae ni ndondo nagae la cinwan ya hukunci yan Soko zhi na to wuncin alheri uyio ya wyuno dan eba Tsociu bo A maa dabba yan eman-wozhi laa jin halali yaye saide nazhi aga gba yaye cigan haramu ayio na Ebo acino e ke gan be shikan yan kuti wuny ye mae keegan be ganmana zun-y
 Being true in faith to Allah and never assigning partners to Him if anyone assigns partners to Allah is as if he had fallen from heaven and been snatched up by birds or the wind had swooped like a bird on its prey and thrown him into a far-distant place,Ye mae la kpatsune taeya Soko baenio ye mae ga la yandondo pau baci ma Zandondo nama gae la yan pa Soko baci na to uyi ke zana cin-cin ya tun dagan sanmao nao elugizhi ci fe dzaugi na koma efe ci lau da cegun danna ndoci na shiko sarauyin nao
 Such is his state and whoever holds in honour the symbols of Allah in the sacrifice of animals such honour should come truly from piety of heart,Wuncinzhi ma danona Zaeni ndondo nagae wan danna ko eyan ibadazhi cin na to hakika wuncin dan mini dansun Soko yan yangbano
In them ye have benefits for a term appointed in the end their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House,Ye ma de eyan anfanizhi dan mini dabbazhio har da lokaci na yi bibaci na gancin danna yan zun-zuna ci yi eba kata na yi sisaci na Harami kpata
To every people did We appoint rites of sacrifice that they might celebrate the name of Allah over the sustenance He gave them from animals fit for food But your god is One God submit then your wills to Him in Islam and give thou the good news to those who humble themselves-,Al-umma ndondo ma Yi la ibada yan eyanzun yaa ebo adebaa tun sunna Sokoa ye eti dabba yan eman-wo nazhi ula yaa arzikina Tsoci ye ma Tsoci Nini Uyio wyun gbaugi gama yea ta kpatsun yao Ye mae la labari yangbanfae ya zanazhi gae dakpya ya Soko na
To those whose hearts when Allah is mentioned are filled with fear who show patient perseverance over their afflictions keep up regular prayer and spend in charity out of what We have bestowed upon them,Agayi Zanazhi kamin-ndondo na aga tun Soko ye na yangbanazhiajin e la du be dansun Sokoe nao to zanazhie jin hakuri eti yandondo naga tswana nao to zanazhie ku salla gikini amae wu dukiyaazhi dagan mini arziki na Yi la yaa na
The sacrificial camels we have made for you as among the symbols from Allah in them is much good for you then pronounce the name of Allah over them as they line up for sacrifice when they are down on their sides after slaughter eat ye thereof and feed such as beg not but live in contentment and such as beg with due humility thus have We made animals subject to you that ye may be grateful,To Rakum-zhi Yia lafe yaye dan mini eyan-ibada yan Soko ye de alheri kanma dan miniabo yaye E fe tun sunna Soko ye ta etiabo kamina agaa tazhizhi naa tunayan na To kamina yegaa zun zo na yetso gi dagan miniubo ye mae ya ninfuci to bukatadecie gi Acinga ga Yijina foro yaye yeo ebo ma yede bae jin yeboe ya Soko
 It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah it is your piety that reaches Him He has thus made them subject to you that ye may glorify Allah for His Guidance to you and proclaim the good news to all who do right,Nakan dabba ye zhi to egyaazhi atun eba Sokoa ammade dansun Soko yan yangba eba zun-zunabo wuncin gaatun ba Soko dagan eba yebo Acinga ga Soko jina foro yaye yeo ebo ma ye-ewan Sokoe cin eti bawu wangi naUla yaye nao Wyo mao ya zanazhie jin bolobolo na labari yangbanfa
Verily Allah will defend from ill those who believe verily Allah loveth not any that is a traitor to faith or show ingratitude,Hakika Sokoe kangwa egun kpaata ya muminizhi Hakika Sokoe wa zandondo na gayi boshi-jinci uci yi manaa woci naa
To those against whom war is made permission is given to fight because they are wronged- and verily Allah is most powerful for their aid-,Ajin izini yan ekun ya zanazhi e gunakun-na ebo na a zawuncinzhi jin zwalunci na Hakika ma Soko de kagbo na Ugaajina taimako na
They are those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right- for no cause except that they say our Lord is Allah Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another there would surely have been pulled down monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure Allah will certainly aid those who aid his cause- for verily Allah is full of Strength Exalted in Might able to enforce His Will,Agayi Zanazhi aa yandzun tinya dagan emiazhio umajin eti hakindondo boa nao saide egan naagan ganSoko tsayi Tsoci yi yio na Kagan umajin ebo gwakan yan Soko ya zandocizhi be zandoci zhi yina daa aga eba ibada yan Nasarazhi gbin ya to cocizhi to masallaci ba nazhie tun sunna Soko ye sarauyin na Hakika ma Sokoajin zandondo nagae jin alamariU taimako na taimako Hakika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe uyio
They are those who if We establish them in the land establish regular prayer and give regular charity enjoin the right and forbid wrong with Allah rests the end and decision of all affairsAgayi zanazhi Yigaaya kini giba yan mulki ta eti kinbo na aajin a salla ku gikini nao amae la zakka wa amaajin afe jin foro be etun alherizhi amae kan etun swakwazhi nao Zoba alamari kpata ma eba Soko wuna zheban lo,
 If they treat thy mission as false so did the peoples before them with their prophets- the People of Noah and ´Ad and Thamud,Ama ga wyo yi ganmana zunci to hakika jamaa yan Nuhuzhi to jamaa yan Aadu zhi to yan Samudu zhi kpaata a Tuciazhi yi ganmana zunci zhi ma
 Those of Abraham and LutT,o jamaa yan Ibrahima zhi to yan Lutu zhi
 And the Companions of the Madyan People and Moses was rejected in the same way But I granted respite to the Unbelievers and only after that did I punish them but how terrible was my rejection of them!,To zaba Madyanazhi ama to Musaotso yi ganmana zunci Micia pata ya kafirizhi gancin Micia wan be azabae to ngba ke ewun-na Mi yi yi nao
How many populations have We destroyed which were given to wrong-doing They tumbled down on their roofs And how many wells are lying idle and neglected and castles lofty and well-built,Alummazhi ma danbo dokun nazhi Yi jin hallaka na ebo na aafe azwalumizhi na Atso cia ni kin zhizhi ta eti ekpo ko yan mulkiazhio to nuwan -- gaazhi ciazhe eyan banza to emi ko nazhiatuna kpaataagbin ya
 Do they not travel through the land so that their hearts and minds may thus learn wisdom and their ears may thus learn to hear Truly it is not their eyes that are blind but their hearts which are in their breasts,Kashi e dazan da kpe eti kinboa ebo ma aade yangban nazhia fe kpaye naa to tukpa nazhia fe wogan naa Ebo na hakika ujin eyezhi tsae naa amaade yangban nazhi fi nakanona gae nao
Yet they ask thee to hasten on the Punishment! But Allah will not fail in His Promise Verily a Day in the sight of thy Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoningAnd they urge you to hasten the punishment But Allah will never fail in His promise And indeed a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of those which you count,
And to how many populations did I give respite which were given to wrong-doing in the end I punished them To me is the destination of all,Alkaryazhi ma dokun nazhi Mi pata ya na alaalima aafe azwalumizhi gancin zunma-- e Mici bea wan be azabae Ezhe keba ma eba Mibo udanoSurah Say O men!

Those who believe and work righteousness for them is forgiveness and a sustenance most generous,To zanazhi ga imani jin acie lotun wangi-wangizhi na gaafara Soko gaajin tabbata yaa ganni be arziki na wancin nae
But those who strive against Our Signs to frustrate them- they will be Companions of the FireZanazhi mae ceko eti nyin-nyin aya Yizhio na acie kpa gan aale egbakpanu ye na to zawuncinzhi ga yi egi mi na yan jahimu zhio,
 Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before thee but when he framed a desire Satan threw some vanity into his desire but Allah will cancel anything vain that Satan throws in and Allah will confirm and establish His Signs for Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom,Ama laade Tuci ko Annabi ndoci shi wyo dzo lea sai de aga jin guri yandoci shetan wyunajin wunela guri dedeu ce dan mini guri wangiabo Soko cie la yan shetan fin ya Gancin Soko ciga ayaUzhi laajin tabbata Soko ma Etsu kpikpe Uyio egba uyio
That He may make the suggestions thrown in by Satan but a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and who are hardened of heart verily the wrong-doers are in a schism far from the Truth,Wyunejin acinga jin Ebo ula yanna shetan ga ce dan bo na ulauzhe fitinau ya zanazhi batan manafinci fi yangbanazhio na to zanazhi yangbanazhia tsua ni na Hakika ma azwalumizhi fi mini cen-leba be Tuciazhi na maa kpeya na
 And that those on whom knowledge has been bestowed may learn that the Qur´an is the Truth from thy Lord and that they may believe therein and their hearts may be made humbly open to it for verily Allah is the Guide of those who believe to the Straight Way,Ebo ma zanazhi Soko la ilimi ya na adebaa kpea wo kede hakika gaskiya dagan eba Tsoci wyobo wyune fe beo na amaala gaskiyaa ya beu yin yangbanazhi ma alaa shia yau Hakika ma Soko ga zanazhia imani jin na wuba lo eko natso yi gboro na
 Those who reject Faith will not cease to be in doubt concerning Revelation until the Hour of Judgment comes suddenly upon them or there comes to them the Penalty of a Day of Disaster,Zanazhio maajin kafirinci na aa pan yeshia aafe jin kelo kezhin dan alamari Alkuranuo har da kamina Alkiyamia be dzun fia kpakete yin nae koma kamina azaba dede a be yaa na
 On that Day of Dominion will be that of Allah He will judge between them so those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight,Mulki ma fo wuncin Soko wuno uma ga hukunci jin tsakani alitazhio baenio Zanazhi maa imani jin aci lo tun wangi-wangizhi na aafi mini Aljanna nazhi yi emi niima zhi na
 And for those who reject Faith and deny our Signs there will be a humiliating Punishment,Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na acia aya Yizhi yi ganmana na to zawuncinzhi azaba yan zunyesun gaajin tabbata yaa
Those who leave their homes in the cause of Allah and are then slain or die- On them will Allah bestow verily a goodly Provision Truly Allah is He Who bestows the best provision,Zanazhi ma kpela dagan dannaazhio ebo Soko na gancin acia wu na ko ma aa tsu ta eti eko wuncino na to hakika Soko gaagba be arziki natso yi wangi nae Soko ga mayi Etsu arzikio
 Verily He will admit them to a place with which they shall be well pleased for Allah is All-Knowing Most Forbearing,Hakika Ugaa la gandan dan-na ndoci naatsoa jin yeda be yin na Hakika ma Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hakuri
That is so And if one has retaliated to no greater extent than the injury he received and is again set upon inordinately Allah will help him for Allah is One that blots out sins and forgives again and again,Wuncinzhi dano na Zaeni ndondo naga da jinga be iri yanna aajinu azaba nae gancin acike da gbin iyaaka tu ta etiubo na hakika Sokoa jinu taimako Hakika Soko Etsu nae fa na Uyio Etsu gaafara Uyio
 That is because Allah merges night into day and He merges day into night and verily it is Allah Who hears and sees all things,Wuncin mayi ebo na hakika Soko gae la yeshi cie lau lo igidio Umae la igidi cie lau lo yeshi Soko ma hakika Etsu nae wo yandondo na Uyio Etsu nae le yandondo ye na
 That is because Allah - He is the Reality and those besides Him whom they invoke- they are but vain Falsehood verily Allah is He Most High Most Great,Wuncin mayi ebona Soko gayi Etsu gaskiyao na hakikama yannazhi e jin bauta ya zunma Ubo na gayi ganmanaonao Hakika ma Soko Etsu elatu Uyio Etsu cinwanci Uyio
Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky and forthwith the earth becomes clothed with green for Allah is He Who understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted with them,Kashi wyo le ye gan Soko gae du ele zhin dagan sanmaboa Ucia jin wyune la kin lazhe fun-furua Hakika Soko Etsu tosayi Uyio Etsu kpikpe
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth for verily Allah- He is free of all wants Worthy of all Praise,Yannazhi fi sanmao kpaata na to yannazhi fi kinbo kpaata na wyun ga wuno Hakika Soko gayi Etsu bagwoo Etsu na zandondoe jin yebo ya nao
Seest thou not that Allah has made subject to you men all that is on the earth and the ships that sail through the sea by His Command He withholds the sky rain from failing on the earth except by His leave for Allah is Most Kind and Most Merciful to man,Wyo le kendoe Soko la yannazhi fi kinbo kpaata na ciajin foro ya ye n ayea to eya nazhie dazan kpe eti eduo na ngan be foro Soko yino Wyunga mae la gwa sun sanma uci cin kpe kinboa yino Kpaatau sai be iziniU yin Hakika Soko lo eba zawangizhi Etsu tosayi Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio

If they do wrangle with thee say Allah knows best what it is ye are doing,Ama gaebe gbomi be wyo yin gangan Hakika Soko de kpikpe gan yan iri etu nazhi yee lo nao
Allah will judge between you on the Day of Judgment concerning the matters in which ye differ,Soko ga hukunci jin tsakaniebo Efo Alkiyamii dan mini yannazhi ye elaace dozhi leba nao
 Knowest thou not that Allah knows all that is in heaven and on earth Indeed it is all in a Record and that is easy for Allah,Kashi wyo kpekpe gan Soko yi be kpikpe yannazhi fi sanmao to kinbo kpaata naa Hakika wuncin kpaata fi mini Litafio Hakika wuncin yanna fan na uyi eba Soko bo
Yet they worship besides Allah things for which no authority has been sent down to them and of which they have really no knowledge for those that do wrong there is no helper,Acie jin bauta ya yandoci najin Sokoa na na ma Soko cin dalili ndondo be etiuboa na amade kpikpe hakika ndoci etiubo na Azwalumizhi maade taimako jincia
When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them thou wilt notice a denial on the faces of the Unbelievers! they nearly attack with violence those who rehearse Our Signs to them Say Shall I tell you of something far worse than these Signs It is the Fire of Hell! Allah has promised it to the Unbelievers! and evil is that destination!,Kandondo na ma aga gba aya Yizhi yaa gbangbae na wyo ale nanvo ye dan eye kafiri zhio aciajin afe jin ke aada cin dan zanazhie gba aya Yizhi yaa be azabae na Gan yaa gan Min yae laabari yan na biye gan wuncin na to wyun gayi enao na Sokoajin kafirizhi alkawali nao zoba maa biye baenio
O men! Here is a parable set forth! listen to it! Those on whom besides Allah ye call cannot create even a fly if they all met together for the purpose! and if the fly should snatch away anything from them they would have no power to release it from the fly Feeble are those who petition and those whom they petition!,Yaye zawangizhi!

No just estimate have they made of Allah for Allah is He Who is strong and able to Carry out His Will,Ama la tsunwan yan cinwan ya Soko kendoe -- yin naa hakika Soko Etsu kagbo Uyio Etsu zankpe Uyio
 Allah chooses messengers from angels and from men for Allah is He Who hears and sees all thingsSokoa jin Utsa Tucizhi dagan mini Malaikazhio to mini zawangizhio Hakika Soko Etsu nae wo na Uyio Etsu nae le yandondo ye na Uyio,

 Who are active in deeds of charity,To za nazhie wa zakka dukiyaazhi na

 Those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants,To zanazhie la tswitswa dan amaanaazhi to alkawali zhi na

 Then We placed him as a drop of sperm in a place of rest firmly fixed,Gancin Yiciu la zhe maniy fi mini danna yan tswitswaci na
 Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood then of that clot We made a foetus lump then we made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh then we developed out of it another creature So blessed be Allah the best to create!,GancinYicia maniy lauzhe egya tsuntsunci egya wuncin Yiciu la zhe nakan tsoka Yicia tsoka wuncinolaazhe tsukunzhi Yicia nakan laakpe tsukun wuncin gancin Yiciu laafe alitta ndoci Hakika albarka Sokoa latu wyunga mayi Egban-ko dan jin-jin alittazhi bo

And We have made above you seven tracts and We are never unmindful of our Creation,Hakika ma Yi jin alitta yan sanma gutwaaba ta tita yebo Yima yaye ke alita Yizhi lugwaa
And We send down water from the sky according to due measure and We cause it to soak in the soil and We certainly are able to drain it off with ease,Yi ma du ele yaye dagan sanmao be gwargwado bukaata yeyin Yiciu laa fedun fi kinbo hakika Yima gboka na Yia lau keya bo wo na
With it We grow for you gardens of date-palms and vines in them have ye abundant fruits and of them ye eat and have enjoyment-,Yi ci jin bata dobinazhi to yan inabizhi yaye be U yin Ye mae de yangici sun-sunzhi to yan finnizhi nazhi yi yan eman-wozhi dokun na miniubo ye mae de yangici gi dagan miniubo
 Also a tree springing out of Mount Sinai which produces oil and relish for those who use it for food,To cigban ndoci nae nyin tinya dagan pati yan Turi Sinaiona wune la emi yan zaituni tinya to emi ndoci zhi nae la gi yangici na
 And in cattle too ye have an instructive example from within their bodies We produce milk for you to drink there are in them besides numerous other benefits for you and of their meat ye eat,Hakika ma mini dabba yan eman-wo yezhio eyan-yekpa danbo Yie ya ye fin mini yannazhi fi gbakoabo na ye mae de eyan anfanizhi dokun dagan miniabo ye mae kezhe gia be
And on them as well as in ships ye ride,Eti dabbazhio to eti eya nuwanzhio e ku ye kpebo lo ebazhi
Further We sent a long line of prophets for your instruction We sent Noah to his people He said O my people! worship Allah! Ye have no other god but Him Will ye not fear Him,Hakika ma Yitun Nuhu fi jamaa yanuzhi u ci gan Ya ye jamaa yan Mizhi! Ejin bauta ya Soko yede Tsoci ndoci zunmaU boa kiI jin yecie sundan Sokoa yino
The chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said He is no more than a man like yourselves his wish is to assert his superiority over you if Allah had wished to send messengers He could have sent down angels never did we hear such a thing as he says among our ancestors of old,Wancin nazhia jin kafirinci dan mini jamaa yanuzhio na ciganNgan za nna u yi zandoa sai de zawangi dozhin ye wyune wa-wa gan ulau de darajauta eti yebo Umaa bo Soko ba daa malaika tsa wyuna cin be ci tunu fi yi yio Yi laa wo iri nana le be yanmanciyi yan mafaarizhi yina
 And some said He is only a man possessed wait and have patience with him for a time,Wyun de fea saide eza baagi na batan al-janizhi dan be yin na Yedea pata yau ye mae fe cin wyunele daa eka degi
Noah said O my Lord! help me for that they accuse me of falsehood!,Ugan Tsoci mi! jin mi taimako eti ganmana na e laaji alamari mi ye na
So We inspired him with this message Construct the Ark within Our sight and under Our guidance then when comes Our Command and the fountains of the earth gush forth take thou on board pairs of every species male and female and thy family- except those of them against whom the Word has already gone forth And address Me not in favour of the wrong-doers for they shall be drowned in the Flood,Yi ci jin wahayi yau kede A eya nuwan kan be eye Yi yin ganni be foro Yi yin gancin kamina foro Yi gabe da be yn etiabo na eye nuwanzhi cie be gutinya na to a eba be yiwoe dagan mini alita ndondo ku fibo to iyaali wtotso zhi sai de na hukunci yan hallaka gaa shidzo ta etiubo miniabo na wyo mao ga gan yandondo be Mi yin eti azwalumizhio ma hakika a gaajin hallaka fi nuwano
And when thou hast embarked on the Ark - thou and those with thee- say Praise be to Allah Who has saved us from the people who do wrong,Gancin kamina to wyoe to zanazhi fibo be wyo yin na ye gaa jin daidai ta eti eyao na to eganganYebo kpaataajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu na wa-yi dzun dagan egun yan azwalumizhio na

Verily in this there are Signs for men to understand thus do We try men,Hakika mini wuncino egwa wu zankpe Soko danbo Yi maafe za nae la miman-cinle ya zawangi zhina
Then We raised after them another generation,Gancin zunmaabo Yici jin alita alumma ndocizhi be
 And We sent to them a messenger from among themselves saying Worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him Will ye not fear Him,Yi ci tun Tuci fia dagan miniabo kede Ejin bauta ya Soko hakika yede Tsoci ndoci zunmau boa Kijin ye cie sundan Sokoa yino
 And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and denied the Meeting in the Hereafter and on whom We had bestowed the good things of this life said He is no more than a man like yourselves he eats of that of which ye eat and drinks of what ye drink,Wancin nazhia jin kafirinci amaa gun-guna be Sokoe yi ganmana na acie gi izhea za naci ganNana ufea saide zawangi dozhin ye wyunegi yangici iri nazhi yegi na umafin dagan mini yannazhi ye fin na
If ye obey a man like yourselves behold it is certain ye will be lost,Hakikama yega mitu zawangi dozhin-ye hakika kanga yegaafe eza asaarazhi
Does he promise that when ye die and become dust and bones ye shall be brought forth again,Kashi wyune jin ye alkawali jin gan yegaa tsu yecia gi ya fi jikannao yecia ke tsukun kanga agaye latin ya be
Far very far is that which ye are promised!,Wunaye jina wunaye jina ya yanna e laajin ye alkawali naa
Surah   There is nothing but our life in this world! We shall die and we live! But we shall never be raised up again!,Yi de izhe le ndoci bea sai de izhele yan izhe yi nana yia tsu yimaa le izhe zando maa san yi dagan kabari boa
He is only a man who invents a lie against Allah but we are not the ones to believe in him!,U fea sai de eza bagi na tswa ganmana ta Soko na Yi maajin imani beu yina
 The prophet said O my Lord! help me for that they accuse me of falsehood,Ugan Tsoci jin mi taimako eti abo be ganmana nae laaji alamari mi ye nae
 Allah said In but a little while they are sure to be sorry!,Ugan Wyuayi be ekpalo ndoci yiaa atsoa tinba tin fe ti ro-- nkpe
Then the Blast overtook them with justice and We made them as rubbish of dead leaves floating on the stream of Time! So away with the people who do wrong!,Gancin kabara ndoci cia wan be kagboe Yi cia la zhe ke fini tsutsucizhi na Emibo maajin tabbata ya jamaa yan azwalumizhi
Then We raised after them other generations,Gancin zunmaabo Yici jin alumma ndocizhi kaa yin be
 No people can hasten their term nor can they delay it,Amade alumma ndoci naa shi lokaci ajaliudzo naa amade naa pata naa
Then sent We our messengers in succession every time there came to a people their messenger they accused him of falsehood so We made them follow each other in punishment We made them as a tale that is told So away with a people that will not believe!,Gancin Yici tun Tuci Yizhi tun lamitu dozhi kandondo na Tuci ga be ya alummau zhina uu yi ganmana Yi ci jin amitu dozhi eti halakao Yicia lafe kaaya etan zhi Emibo maajin tabbata ta eti zanazhie jin imania na
 Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our Signs and authority manifest,Gancin Yici tun Musa to yegiu Haruna tun be aya Yizhi ganni be hujja zhi nazhi yi gbangba na
 To Pharaoh and his Chiefs But these behaved insolently they were an arrogant people,Lo eba Firauna be wancin yanuzhi majalisauzhi a cia gbotika acia fe eyewucizhi
They said Shall we believe in two men like ourselves And their people are subject to us!,A cigan Ngba yi ga imani jin ebo zawangi guba nazhi yi dozhin yizhina alaali ma za miazhi kpaata wuzhi Yizhi ayio na
 So they accused them of falsehood and they became of those who were destroyed,Acia eganazhi yi ganmana aciafe dan mini zanazhia-jin hallaka naSurah And We gave Moses the Book in order that they might receive guidanceHakika ma Yi la Litafi Attaura ya Musa ujin-wo be wunciny alaade bawu
 And We made the son of Mary and his mother as a Sign We gave them both shelter on high ground affording rest and security and furnished with springs,Yi ma cia egi Maryama to Nnau laafe aya Yici yaa edun feba dan pati ndocio bana aade efa nuwan mae je na
O ye messengers! enjoy all things good and pure and work righteousness for I am well-acquainted with all that ye do,Ya ye Tucizhi! E gi dagan mini yangici lilici zhio ye mae lotun wangi Hakika Mi yi be kpikpe etun nazhi ye lo na
And verily this Brotherhood of yours is a single Brotherhood and I am your Lord and Cherisher therefore fear Me and no other,Hakika ma alumma ye nana alumma nini yeyi Mi ma ga yi Tsoci ye yeo ebo acino e sundan Mi
 But people have cut off their affair of unity between them into sects each party rejoices in that which is with itself,A cia alamariazhi sa-ya tsakaniabo bedozhi kpere-kpere ena ndondo cie jin alfahri be yanuyin
 But leave them in their confused ignorance for a time,To a ya gun mini pipeazhio har da lokaci ndoci
 But leave them in their confused ignorance for a time,To a ya gun mini pipeazhio har da lokaci ndoci
 Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and sons,Kashi e leye le gan ekundo yan arziki be egizhi na Yie la yaa na
 We would hasten them on in every good Nay they do not understand,E leye le gan gbatawo uyio yan etun alheri na ade lo nao Aa ujin acina amaade ajin fahimtaa
Verily those who live in awe for fear of their Lord,Hakika zanazhie sundan azaba Tsocia acie tswaU na
Those who believe in the Signs of their Lord,To zanazhie jin imani be ayazhi yan Tsocia yin nae
Those who join not in worship partners with their Lord,To zanazhi e la yandoci aa pa Tsocia bacia na
And those who dispense their charity with their hearts full of fear because they will return to their Lord-,To zanazhie twarya be yandondoe wo na gancin yangbanazhi mae laashe be dansuny kede eba Tsocia tsa aa sheban lo na
It is these who hasten in every good work and these who are foremost in them,Zawuncinzhi kpaata aafe zanazhie dinye dan etun alherizhio na amaajin afe sanga-na danbo na
 On no soul do We place a burden greater than it can bear before Us is a record which clearly shows the truth they will never be wronged,Yi mae la kpaka ta rayia saide yan yanna ugade ba-- u na Litafi madan eba Yibo nae gangan be gaskiyae na Amaa jina zwaluncia
But their hearts are in confused ignorance of this and there are besides that deeds of theirs which they will continue to do-,Aa yangbanazhi de dan mini pipeo eti alamari Alkuranu nanao amayi be etun docizhi be banbe nanazhi na aajina lo na
 Until when We seize in Punishment those of them who received the good things of this world behold they will groan in supplication!,Harda kamina Yi ga kaafa decizhi wan be azabae na Kanga gancin acia fe gbindun
It will be said Groan not in supplication this day for ye shall certainly not be helped by Us,E ga gbindun ndondo yinna ma hakika zandondo danbo naajin ye taimako ke azaba Yi lugwa naa
My Signs used to be rehearsed to you but ye used to turn back on your heels-,Hakika aafe afe gba aya Mizhi ya ye ye ciafe zanazhie yati lo zunma na

e to their fathers of old,Kiila acie kpaye na shidu na etiuboa yino kashi yandoci tsa be ya ao na ma be ya yanmanciazhi yan mafaria nao
Or do they not recognise their Messenger that they deny him,Kashi akpe Tucia kpe yea a ciafe zanazhie la nanvo wuu na

If the Truth had been in accord with their desires truly the heavens and the earth and all beings therein would have been in confusion and corruption! Nay We have sent them their admonition but they turn away from their admonition,Daaci gan gaskiya gamitu etun yangbanazhi tu da sanmazhi to kin to yannazhi fi tacinabo kpaata na gaa nyin-ya Hakika Yide bebe yaye be eyan cinwan yeyin acie laa bici ke eyan cinwana lugwa
Or is it that thou askest them for some recompense But the recompense of thy Lord is best He is the Best of those who give sustenance,Kashi wyoe gbinagan edu gbin yan laada etun na wyoe lo na Ngan laada yan Tsoci wyoe uga de alheri gano Soko gamayi Etsu arzikio
But verily thou callest them to the Straight Way,Hakika ma wyoe yia yi lo eko natso yi gboro na
And verily those who believe not in the Hereafter are deviating from that Way,Hakika ma za nazhie jin imani be Alkiyami yina na e laapan ke eko gboro lugwa
If We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them they would obstinately persist in their transgression wandering in distraction to and fro,Kaa ma Yi ga gunaye Yicia egun nadan bea yin na laake yabo yaa aafe pepe gun mini gbingbin tuazhio
We inflicted Punishment on them but they humbled not themselves to their Lord nor do they submissively entreat Him!-,Hakika ma Yi wana be azaba yinani ama ta kpatsun ya Tsociaa ama da ti ci cia
Until We open on them a gate leading to a severe Punishment then Lo! they will be plunged in despair therein! ,Har daa kamina Yiga kpe eko azaba dede yaa na wyoa tsuna agaa gizhi fibo
 It is He Who has created for you the faculties of hearing sight feeling and understanding little thanks it is ye give!,Wyun gayi Etsu najin gan-wo to bayele to yangban yaye nao degi gama ye jin yebo

 On the contrary they say things similar to what the ancients said,Aa ade gangan gan iri na za mafarizhi gan na
 They say What! when we die and become dust and bones could we really be raised up again,Agan Ngba Yigaa tsu Yicia gi ya fi jikannao cia ke tsukunzhi agayi la nakin kabario
 Such things have been promised to us and to our fathers before! they are nothing but tales of the ancients!,Hakika to yi to yanmanci yizhi ajin yi alkawali nana leani alkawali nana ma ufea sai de ecin yan za paa yin zhi

Repel evil with that which is best We are well acquainted with the things they say,A eyan dede dagwa ya be yan natso gyegan nae Hakika Yikpe yannazhi e laa ji wyo ye kpaata na

 And I seek refuge with Thee O my Lord! lest they should come near me,Mimae ba etswa be wyo yin ebo aga be eba mi ma
 In Falsehood will they be Until when death comes to one of them he says O my Lord! send me back to life-,Har da kamina ajali ga be ya zaeni mini abo na ugan Tsoci a mi la zheban daa izhe
In order that I may work righteousness in the things I neglected - By no means! It is but a word he says- Before them is a Partition till the Day they are raised up,Ujin wo ko mia da lotun guruzhi dan mini yannazhi mi yadan zunmao na Ba wunaye jino!

 Then those whose balance of good deeds is heavy- they will attain salvation,To zandondo na tsunwan etun guruu gaa lukpin na to zawuncinzhia de robo
 But those whose balance is light will be those who have lost their souls in Hell will they abide,Zana ma tsunwan etunu gaa cin-dan na to zawuncinzhia asara ladan eti tacina ama gaa gan dan ena jahannamao tutun yino
The Fire will burn their faces and they will therein grin with their lips displaced,Ena cia fe nia fuskazhi mu amaafibo fi fuska nyin-nyin ci

 A sura which We have sent down and which We have ordained in it have We sent down Clear Signs in order that ye may receive admonition,Nana Sura uyio na Yi cin be na Yi maa hukunci nazhi fibo na laazhe wajibi Yima cin ayazhi be fi bo nazhi bayaniazhi yi gangba na ebo be wunciny ye lae sanetu
 The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication- flog each of them with a hundred stripes Let not compassion move you in their case in a matter prescribed by Allah if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment,Yancin daci yinzagi to yancin daci bagi edin zaeni ndondo miniabo bulala shitsun ye mae ga lugwa yegun ndoci lo-ye beayin dan mini alamari adini Soko nanao ma ye gaafe gan yea imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae na Amaade jamaa mini muminizhio nazhia jin ri yan haddi bulala nana na
And those who launch a charge against chaste women and produce not four witnesses to support their allegations- flog them with eighty stripes and reject their evidence ever after for such men are wicked transgressors-,To zanazhi maajin afe ce egan yan yancinda ta yinzagi nazhi yibe yawoe na gancin ama be be eri gunni yinana to edina bulala shini ye mae ga -- eri egwaabo be ma har abada za wuncin zhima agayi fasikizhio
 Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry and but a woman similarly guilty or an Unbeliever nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman to the Believers such a thing is forbidden,Yancin daci bagi wyuna jin yawoa sai be yancin daci yinzagi na yi yancin dacina zan dondoa jinu yawoa sai yancindaci bagi ko mushriki ama wuncin laajin haramu ya muminizhi
Unless they repent thereafter and mend their conduct for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de zanazhi ga tuba jin zunma wuncinona acia bolobolo ladan etunazhio na to hakika Soko Etsu gaafara uyio Etsu yegun Uyio
 And for those who launch a charge against their spouses and have in support no evidence but their own- their solitary evidence can be received if they bear witness four times with an oath by Allah that they are solemnly telling the truth,To zanazhi maajin afe ce egan yacin-da da ba yinmiazhina amade eri ndondoa sai eti tacina na to eri na zandondoa ya na uga yi ula eriu ya be sunna Sokoe zun gunni kede hakika gaskiya wyune tao na
And the fifth oath should be that they solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on themselves if they tell a lie,Yan tsunci gancin uciu gangan Emibo yan Soko ulaujin tabbatauta eti wyun bo wyun gaafe dan mini ganmana zunci zhio naS
But it would avert the punishment from the wife if she bears witness four times with an oath By Allah that her husband is telling a lie,Yanna maada azaba haddi gwa ya eti yin mio na ugayi wyuntsoula eriu ya be sunna Sokoe zu-gunni kede hakika eba wyunafe dan mini ganmana zunci zhio no wato ganmana eba zuno
 And the fifth oath should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if her accuser is telling the truth,Yan tsunci gancin kede hakika ewunzhe yan Sokoulaujin tabbatauta eti wyun bo wunayi gaskiya eba wyun tao na
If it were not for Allah´s grace and mercy on you and that Allah is Oft-Returning full of Wisdom- Ye would be ruined indeed,Kagan ujin ebo falala yan Soko be yegunuyin ta eti yebo naa Soko ma kezhe aafe Etsu nae -- tuba na Etsu na yi Egba na
Those who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves think it not to be an evil to you On the contrary it is good for you to every man among them will come the punishment of the sin that he earned and to him who took on himself the lead among them will be a penalty grievous,Hakika zanazhi be be egan ganmana gbonta wuncinina jamaa ndoci ayio dagan miniyebo to ega leuye ke eyan dede wunayi yayeo ma aa alheri wunay ya yeyeo Zaeni ndondo miniabo yibe zunubi yanna ujin yan lefi nazana ma shiti yan etun dede wuncin na azaba na gbota na gaajin tabbata yau
Why did not the believers - men and women - when ye heard of the affair- put the best construction on it in their own minds and say This charge is an obvious lie,Kiila kamina ye wo egan nana-na muminizhi to bagi to yinzagi aci jin zato wangi loba dozhia yino Acia gangan nana de ganmana tswitswaci uyio nayi gbangba na
Why did they not bring four witnesses to prove it When they have not brought the witnesses such men in the sight of Allah stand forth themselves as liars!,Kiila aci be be eri gunni yina yino To dagan na abe be erizhi yina na to zawuncinzhi eba Soko agayi ganmana-zunci zhio
Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you in this world and the Hereafter a grievous penalty would have seized you in that ye rushed glibly into this affair,Kagan umajin ebo falala Soko be yegunU yin na tati yebo izheo to ekuo naa daa azaba na gbota na gaade ye dan mini etun nazhi yelo nao
 Behold ye received it on your tongues and said out of your mouths things of which ye had no knowledge and ye thought it to be a light matter while it was most serious in the sight of Allah,Kamina ye fe tswa eganzhi gan begintra ye yin na yeci fe da gan gan be misun yezhi yan yannazhi yede kpikpeaa na ye cie le ye gan yanna de sauki na uyio alaalima yanna gbota na uyi eba Soko bo

Allah doth admonish you that ye may never repeat such conduct if ye are true Believers,Sokoe nae wun yega kaara jin iri wuncin be ma har abada wunayi muminizhi ye yio na
And Allah makes the Signs plain to you for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom,Soko mae jin bayani ayazhi yaye Soko ma Etsu kpikpe Uyio Etsu hikima

O ye who believe! follow not Satan´s footsteps if any will follow the footsteps of Satan he will but command what is shameful and wrong and were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you not one of you would ever have been pure but Allah doth purify whom He pleases and Allah is One Who hears and knows all things,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

 Let not those among you who are endued with grace and amplitude of means resolve by oath against helping their kinsmen those in want and those who have left their homes in Allah´s cause let them forgive and overlook do you not wish that Allah should forgive you For Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Zanazhi mayi eza falalazhi mini yebo amayi eza bagwo na aga zhi kuti gan aajin alheri ya dangi yan tsonba zhia mato eza gwagbagizhi to zanazhi kpela dagan ezhiazhio bo Sokona Aa fa be dozhi ajin sauki yadozhi Kashi ye wawa gan SokoU fa be ye yina Soko ma Etsu gafara Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio

Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp the Lamp enclosed in Glass the glass as it were a brilliant star Lit from a blessed Tree an Olive neither of the east nor of the west whose oil is well-nigh luminous though fire scarce touched it Light upon Light! Allah doth guide whom He will to His Light Allah doth set forth Parables for men and Allah doth know all things,Soko gayi Hiske-ko yan sanmazhi to kin yino kotonci yan HaskeU ke mishkatna fitila gun miniu bonafitila wuncin ma ugun mini kpalabao kpalaba wuncin ma ke wyoa ye gan ko tswangi aluului na uyio e danudan be emi cigban ndoci na yi yan albarka na na yi yan zaituni na Ujin dagabn kansanta igidi lababoa umajin dagan kansanta emi loba igidi boa Eminu cie jinke wuna dan etiu na tobootso enauga tou maHaske Uyio ta eti haskeo Soko mae la kotoncizhi be ya zawangizhi Soko ma yibe kpikpe yandondoe

But the Unbelievers- their deeds are like a mirage in sandy deserts which the man parched with thirst mistakes for water until when he comes up to it he finds it to be nothing But he finds Allah ever with him and Allah will pay him his account and Allah is swift in taking account,Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na etunazhi uyi ke kotonkoci kin na igidi sankpe na dagan ba kpaako zana nuwane wo na ga leuye wyuna ye gan ko nuwan yan gaskiyao har sai kamina ugabe tun baga na wyunatsun yando ciboa Ucia da tsun zankpe Soko dan bagao Soko ci ga egagbaU laayau Soko ma Etsu na fan eba egagba bo na Uyio

 Yea to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and to Allah is the final goal of all,Soko gama wyun mulki sanmazhi to kin yino EbaU gabo ma ezhekeba kpaata dano
Seest thou not that Allah makes the clouds move gently then joins them together then makes them into a heap - then wilt thou see rain issue forth from their midst And He sends down from the sky mountain masses of clouds wherein is hail He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases the vivid flash of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight,Wyo le kendoe Sokoajin Ufe da girgijezhi gwa na yea gancin Ucia jin Wyuna kukeba be dozhi gabcin Uci gaa latu ta etidozhio wyocia le nuwan ye wunajin ufe tinya tsakaniabo Umaajin U duzhin dagan sanmao nuwan yan kankarazhi Uciajin udule wuncin fi za na gabaUna Umae lau kan zana ga baUna haske yan sanma dzwanuzhi e jinke aga eye zawangizhi na-na

O ye who believe! let those whom your right hands possess and the children among you who have not come of age ask your permission before they come to your presence on three occasions before morning prayer the while ye doff your clothes for the noonday heat and after the late-night prayer these are your three times of undress outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about attending to each other Thus does Allah make clear the Signs to you for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage- there is no blame on them if they lay aside their outer garments provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty but it is best for them to be modest and Allah is One Who sees and knows all things,Zanazhi maa kuku mini yinzagi yezhio na nazhi mae jin kauna yan yawo jin bea na lefi danboa naajin sauki eba ede dzua zhio naa amaade aga fe la ninpaazhi wu dan de boma ama ga wan miniadan be sutura jiny wuncin de alheri yaa gan Soko ma Etsu nae wo na Uyio Etsu kpikpe Uyio

Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger when they are with him on a matter requiring collective action they do not depart until they have asked for his leave those who ask for thy leave are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger so when they ask for thy leave for some business of theirs give leave to those of them whom thou wilt and ask Allah for their forgiveness for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Hakika de zanazhi yi muminizhi na agayi zanazhia imani jin be Sokoe to be TuciUyin nao Ama gaafe dan beUyin eti alamari ndoci nayi yan jamaa zhi na e nakin lo bandoaa sai de be izini U yin Hakika za nazhie wa izini wyo bedzo na agayi zanazhia imani jin be Sokoe to be Tucii nao To kandodona aga be wa izini wyo eti shaani ndoci zhio na to jin izini ya zana ga ba wyoe miniabo na Wyo mao wa gaafara Sokooyaa hakika Soko Etsu gaafara Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio
Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse then let those beware who withstand the Messenger´s order lest some trial befall them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them,E ga la yi-yi eye-yi yan Tuci Soko tsakaniebo be dozhi dozhi yi yi yetso be dozhiI ma Hakika Soko kpe zanazhi wa ya mini yebo swiswoci-y-na To hakika zanazhie ce leba forou na aa tswa minia kacana fitinaa Alkiyamio

Blessed is He who sent down the criterion to His servant that it may be an admonition to all creatures-,Soko Etsu na cin Alkuranu be ya wuzhiU eboulaufe sinsantuuya alitazhi kpaatana wyuna latu be albarkae
He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth no son has He begotten nor has He a partner in His dominion it is He who created all things and ordered them in due proportions,Etsu na wun mulki sanmazhi to kin na Uma de egi ndondoa Uma de ema-paci dan mini mulkiUboa Wyunga majin alita yandondo Ucia tsunwan laayau gwargwado kendoe wyunagwo yandon yin na

But the misbelievers say Naught is this but a lie which he has forged and others have helped him at it In truth it is they who have put forward an iniquity and a falsehood,Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na ganAkika Alkuranu nana ufea saide ganmana tswitswaci jamaa ndocizhi kaayin ma aga jinu taimako eti wuncin bo To akika a etun zwalunci lo be etun ganmanae

 Say The Qur´an was sent down by Him who knows the mystery that is in the heavens and the earth verily He is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Gan yaa gan Etsu nade kpikpe asiri nazhi fi sanmazhio to kin bo na Wyunga cin Alkuranu beo Hakika Sokoafe Etsu gaafara Etsu yegun
And they say What sort of a messenger is this who eats food and walks through the streets Why has not an angel been sent down to him to give admonition with him,Aci ganKii la Tuci nana cie gi yangicio ucie dazan dan dzukozhi bo Kii jin aci cin malaika be pama beuyin ebo ufeu bau gangba jin reayino
Or Why has not a treasure been bestowed on him or why has he not a garden for enjoyment The wicked say Ye follow none other than a man bewitched,Ko ma a cin edzunba arziki ndociayau koma bata ndoci bana wyunafe gi yan zhi naa yino Azwalumizhi ci ganYede de zandoe la mitua saide eza bagi naajin shiri na
See what kinds of comparisons they make for thee! But they have gone astray and never a way will they be able to find!,Cin le kendoe e jin wyo kotoncizhi kakayin na har atsoa gbin eko bawu gboro ci ye la mitu yaa bea
 Blessed is He who if that were His will could give thee better things than those- Gardens beneath which rivers flow and He could give thee palaces secure to dwell in,Albarka yan Sokoa latu Etsu na Uga baU wyuna jin alherizhi ya wyoe nagan wuncin zhi na u gayi batakozhi nazhi nuwan zhie je fi takoabo nao Umaa kezhe yao emi wanciko-ko zhi

 When it sees them from a place fAr off they will hear its fury and its ranging sigh,Kamina ena ga leaya dagan ba kpaakoona aafe wo edun gbinu be sisau yin
And when they are cast bound together into a constricted place therein they will pLead for destruction there and then!,Ama ga bea ku ce fi bo dan mini danna na yi pin-pin ci na acia pa--- dozhi atsoa fe yi kaba naa hallaka baagaoSurah This day plead not for a single destruction plead for destruction oft-repeated!Acia gana gan Ega yi kabara hallaka nini yinna ma e gaa yi kabara e yiu dokun

The day He will gather them together as well as those whom they worship besides Allah He will ask Was it ye who let these My servants astray or did they stray from the Path themselves,wyo mao pa Efo na Ugaa kua yekan zhi-zhi to yannazhie jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa baenio na ucia ganaganNgba ye ga ku wuzhi Mi nanazhi da fi egbin bo kashi atso tsa gbinka ke eko lugwao
 They will say Glory to Thee! not meet was it for us that we should take for protectors others besides Thee But Thou didst bestow on them and their fathers good things in life until they forgot the Message for they were a people worthless and lost,AganLili kpataajin tabbata ya wyoe U gwoyin yayi na yiada la Ndakata ndocizhi ke wyo Soko lugwa naa amaade wyo ga yaa eman-wo to atso to yanmanciazhio har acia pipa wyo batan aciafe eza hallakazhi
Allah will say Now have they proved you liars in what ye say so ye cannot avert your penalty nor get help And whoever among you does wrong him shall We cause to taste of a grievous Penalty,To hakika a egan yezhi dza ganmanaa ni ebo acino ye de bandoa zheban loa ye maade taimako ndondoa Zaeni ndondo na ma ga jin zwalunci minie bo-na Yia yau azaba na wancin na fin
And the messengers whom We sent before thee were all men who ate food and walked through the streets We have made some of you as a trial for others will ye have patience for Allah is One Who sees all things,Yima laatun Tucizhi tun shi wyo dzo lea saide hakika aafe zanazhie gi yangici na amae dazan dan dzukozhio Yimaa saashi yezhi laafe fitina ya saashiezhi ko ye yeajin hakuri be dozhi Tsoci wyo maafe Etsu nae le ba ye na

Such as fear not the meeting with Us for Judgment say Why are not the angels sent down to us or why do we not see our Lord Indeed they have an arrogant conceit of themselves and mighty is the insolence of their impiety!,Zanazhi mae jin kauna gungun wangi be Yi-yia na ganKi la aci cin malaikazhi be ya yi-yia yano ko ma kila yi cia le Tsoci yi yea yino Hakika a eti ladanfino be cinwan titacina naa leye na amaa gbotika eti kagbo na wancin na
The Day they see the angels- no joy will there be to the sinners that Day The angels will say There is a barrier forbidden to you altogether!,Efo na agaale malaikazhi ye na fo wuncin yangbanfa ndondoa danbo ya lefi jincizhia acia fe gangan Etswa de etswa deSoko u -- yi-yi Utswa
And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did in this life and We shall make such deeds as floating dust scattered about,Yi cia etun nazhia lo na kuzhi yegboro Yiciu laafe rungba naa ga ya na
The Companions of the Garden will be well that Day in their abode and have the fairest of places for reposeEgi Aljannazhi foga aga de edunfeba wangi gano agamade ele leba wangi gano,
 The Day the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds and angels shall be sent down descending in ranks-,Wyo mao feo pa Efo na sanmaabe lafi be girgi je na Yicia cin malaikazhi zhin cin-cin zhin yan baeni
 The Day that the wrong-doer will bite at his hands he will say Oh! would that I had taken a straight path with the Messenger!,Wyo mao pa Efo na azwalumi ga egwa gubaabau kufi misuno cia fe dzaugi nawyuntso ciafe ganganKaasa re! E gan gan mia emi latu Tuci Soko ta eti ekpa gboro boa
Ah! woe is me! Would that I had never taken such a one for a friend!,Kaasa mi re! E gangan mi la zawani eya mancia yina
He did lead me astray from the Message of Allah after it had come to me! Ah! the Evil One is but a traitor to man!,Hakika wyuna mi gbin ke Alkuranu lugwa baaci na bawu dabe yami-yinani na Shetan ma za nae gba zawangi na uyio
Then the Messenger will say O my Lord! Truly my people took this Qur´an for just foolish nonsense,Tuci Soko magan  Ya wyoe Tsoci! Hakika ekundondo jamaa yan mizhi a Alkuranu la sungwa acia kpela be etun lo be uyiny
Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help,Acinga ga Yi la makirizhi ya Annabi ndondo dagan mini lefi jincinzhibo Tsoci wyoe maa kunke Etsu bawu Etsu taimako
 Those who reject Faith say Why is not the Qur´an revealed to him all at once Thus is it revealed that We may strengthen thy heart thereby and We have rehearsed it to thee in slow well-arranged stages gradually,Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na gan Ki la aci cin kuranu be yau baeni boa yino Acinga ga Yi kpa cincinu degi degio ebo Yii shi wyo yangbany ta beu yino Yiciu gba ya wyoe jaajaa yino
And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth and the best explanation thereof,Amaa be ya wyoe be misali ndoci yina sai ma yitsoa be ya wyoe be gaskiyae ganni be bayani na gyegan nae
 Those who will be gathered to Hell prone on their faces- they will be in an evil plight and as to Path most astray,Zanazhi ma aa kua ku lo ena jahannama be fuskaazhi zhi zhe kpeci kpe kinbo na to zawuncinzhi kinigibaa biye gan ekoa ma gbin gan
Before this We sent Moses The Book and appointed his brother Aaron with him as minister,Hakika maYila Litafi ya Musa Yicia yegiu Haruna laagi kinigib wazirio yau
And We command Go ye both to the people who have rejected our Signs And those people We destroyed with utter destruction,Yici gana gan Efe lo eba jamaa nazhia ayazhi yan Yi yi ganmana na Yicia tanfi tintanfi yan bae ni
 And the people of Noah- when they rejected the messengers We drowned them and We made them as a Sign for mankind and We have prepared for all wrong-doers a grievous Penalty-,To jamaa yan Nuhu zhi kamina a yi egan Tucizhi ganmana na Yia gbin fi nuwano Yi cia la fe aya ya zawangi zhi Yi majin shiri azaba na tan sarauyin na ya azwalumizhi
 As also ´Ad and Thamud and the Companions of the Rass and many a generation between them,To Aduzhi to Samuduzhi to zaba -- ga Rassuzhi to alumma nazhi dokun fi tacin wuncinzhio na kpaataa Yia jin hallaka
To each one We set forth Parables and examples and each one We broke to utter annihilation for their sins,Ndondoa ma Yi la misaalizhi be ndondoa ma Yiujin hallaka hallaka dede
 And the Unbelievers must indeed have passed by the town on which was rained a shower of evil did they not then see it with their own eyes But they fear not the Resurrection,Hakika atso kafirizhi a da tacin alkarya wuncin naadu le azaba kpe na -- gan kashi a leu ye lea Aa ujinacina ade afe zanazhie jin kauna ekin na Alkiyamia na
And the Unbelievers must indeed have passed by the town on which was rained a shower of evil did they not then see it with their own eyes But they fear not the Resurrection,Hakika atso kafirizhi a da tacin alkarya wuncin naadu le azaba kpe na -- gan kashi a leu ye lea Aa ujinacina ade afe zanazhie jin kauna ekin na Alkiyamia na
 When they see thee they treat thee no otherwise than in mockery Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a messenger,Kamina ma aga le wyo ye na e la wyo yandondoa saide eyan emila Acia fe gan gan Nga zanna ga Soko tuntun cia zhe Tucio
He indeed would well-nigh have misled us from our gods had it not been that we were constant to them! - Soon will they know when they see the Penalty who it is that is most misled in Path!,Hakika degi keo kacana uga yi gbin ke kutiyizhi lugwa kaujin ebona yia yangban wu gban-yin bea yin naa Bele yin ma aa be de kpikpe zana ga gbinka gan na efo na agaa le azaba ye na
Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion or impulse Couldst thou be a disposer of affairs for him,Ngba wyo le zanaa etun yangbanu la Tsoci u na yea ngba wyo gikini fe tswa za wuncin wo ebo uga lamitu etun yangbanu be ma
Or thinkest thou that most of them listen or understand They are only like cattle- nay they are worse astray in Path,Kashi wyoe kpa ye kpa gan ekun dondoa e wogan wo yan fahimta ko ma e la hankali la tu yan na e wo na Ngan afea sai de ke dabbazhi na aa atso ke gbin gan eba gbugbu keo
Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord- How He doth prolong the shadow! If He willed He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun its guide,Wyo le etun Tsoci wyo yea kendoe uta fifingi cici naa Ngan wuna baUba Ugau kangikini cin yin Gancin Yicia igidi laazhe dalili ta etiubo
Then We draw it in towards Ourselves- a contraction by easy stages,Gancin Yicie lau wan zhin eba Yi karaayin karaayin
And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you and Sleep as Repose and makes the Day as it were a Resurrection,Wyun ga ma la yeshi cia fe sutura ya ye yeo elele ma cia fe efa Ucia batin laafe lokaci ekin na ebo wiwa asiri so
And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings going before His mercy and We send down pure water from the sky-,Wyunga maajin Utun efe zhi ebo alaafe labari yangban fa ya yegunU na wyuna cin be na Yi mae du ele be yaye dagan sanmao nuwan na yi lilici na
 That with it We may give life to a dead land and slake the thirst of things We have created- cattle and men in great numbers,Ebo Yii la ezhi tsutsuci zhiy dan rayi Yi ma-y la nuwan-y-ya yannazhi Yijin alittaa dagan mini dabbazhio to ekun dondo zawangizhio na-y-fin
 And We have distributed the water amongst them in order that they may celebrate our praises but most men are averse to aught but rank ingratitude,Hakika ma Yia Alkuranu laa zhe-gwa dan taacinabo ebo alaa sanatu ekun dondoa ma aa navo sai de kafirinci naa jin na
 Had it been Our Will We could have sent a warner to every centre of population,Uma ga ba Yi ba daa Yiga gangba jinci tun fi alumma ndondo
Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness with the Qur´an,Wyo mao ga lamitu etun yangban yan kafirizhi ma wyo mao gunakun be Alkuranu nanae ekun na wancin na
 It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water One palatable and sweet and the other salt and bitter yet has He made a barrier between them a partition that is forbidden to be passed,Wyunga ma la edu guba cia kebao Nana yi managi uma fan-yn fin nana mayi esan-esan vunvunci Ucia yekan ndoci laadan tsakaniabo be dozhi be gwakan nae kangwa bibo keba yaa na
 It is He Who has created man from water then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage for thy Lord has power over all things,Wyunga majin alitta zawangi dagan nuwan bo U ciu laa fe dangi yan mima be dangi yan yele boeo Tsoci wyo maafe Etsu nade iiko na
 Yet do they worship besides Allah things that can neither profit them nor harm them and the Misbeliever is a helper of Evil against his own Lord!,Acie dajin bauta ya yandoci najin Sokoa na na ma jina anfanio woa uma la egun tswana woa na Hakika kafiriafe ragban zhici fi Tsociu
 But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition,Yima tun wyo tun-tun saide ebo wyo laofe za na ya muminizhi bushaara na to za na maajin kafirizhi gangba na
 Say No reward do I ask of you for it but this that each one who will may take a straight Path to his Lord,Gan yaa ganMi ma gbin ye gan yan laada ndondo eti gangba na mie jin ye naboa sai de wunake dangwa yebo zana uga bana ula miutu ekpa gboro lo eba Tsociu
And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not and celebrate his praise and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants-,Wyo mao lao yaokpe Soko Etsu rayi nae tsua na wyo mao feo liu tsatsayin be yebo jinu yin Soko maa kunke be kpikpe zunubi nazhi wuzhiuzhie jin nae
 He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between in six days and is firmly established on the Throne of Authority Allah Most Gracious ask thou then about Him of any acquainted with such things,Wyun gayi Etsu najin alitta sanmazhi to kin to yannazhi fi taacina bo na dan mini fo gutsunayino nao gancin Ucia jin daidaita eti Alarashi Ubo Etsu yegun gbinUgan eti ubo Wyun gayi Etsu kpikpeo
 When it is said to them Prostrate to Allah Most Gracious! they say And what is Allah Most Gracious Shall we prostrate to that which thou commandest us And it increases their flight from the Truth,A ma ga gan yaa gan  Ejin sujada ya Soko AL-RAHMANUO agan zie ye ARRAHMANUO Gbani wyo wa-wa gan yi-y jin sujada yiya yanna wyoe jin yi foro etiubo na Nana maajin ufe bea kpikpe ya be gaskiyae be
 Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light,Sokoa latu Etsu na la ecinba yan tswangi zhi dan sanmao na Ucia igidi be etswa nade haske sarauyin na laadan bo
And it is He Who made the Night and the Day to follow each other for such as have the will to celebrate His praises or to show their gratitude,Wyunga ma la yeshi to yigidi cie laa sangwa dozhio ebo ulaufe bibeu ya zana gaa santu na be zana gae kpa gan wyunajin yebo na
 And the servants of Allah Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility and when the ignorant address them they say Peace!,Wuzhi Soko ARRAHMANU zhi agayi zanazhie dazan kpe ti kinbo be hankali nao jahili wawazhi maga gangan gbugbuke bea yin aajin a gan ganAminci aminci
Those who spend the night in adoration of their Lord prostrate and standing,Zanazhi aajin afe zhi-le fe jin sujada be salla yeshii na
 Those who say Our Lord! avert from us the Wrath of Hell for its Wrath is indeed an affliction grievous-T,o zanazhi aajin afe gangan Tsoci yi!

 Those who when they spend are not extravagant and not niggardly but hold a just balance between those extremes,To zanazhi agae wu dukiyaazhi e nyinu yaa amae tanyanboa na adeajin a dan tatacin wuncino na
Those who invoke not with Allah any other god nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred except for just cause nor commit fornication - and any that does this not only meets punishment,To zanazhi e jin bauta ya kuti ndoci pama ganni be Soko yina na amae wu rayi na Sokoa lazhe haramu naa sai de eti gasakiya yan shario to zanazhie da yancinana Zaeni ndondo na ma gajin acin na wyuna gun be azaba lefizhi
But the Penalty on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him and he will dwell therein in ignominy-,Aga azaba zhi kpeba dozhi yau Efo Alkiyami uma gaajin dawwama danbo eza gbigbaci
 Unless he repents believes and works righteous deeds for Allah will change the evil of such persons into good and Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de zana ga tuba jin ucia imani wangi jin uci lotun etun nayi wangi na to zawuncinzhi Soko ga etun dedeazhi sangwa be bolobolozhi Soko maafe Etsu gaafara Etsu yegun
And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah with an acceptable conversion-,Zaeni ndondo na ga tuba jin na uci lo tun wangi na to zawuncina tuba jin lo eba Soko baenio
 Those who witness no falsehood and if they pass by futility they pass by it with honourable avoidance,To zanazhie jin ri ganmanaa na ka ama ga be da edzoba -- gan aajin a-- gan -- be cinwane na
Those who when they are admonished with the Signs of their Lord droop not down at them as if they were deaf or blind,To zanazhi aga sanatu be ayazhi yan Tsocia yin na e fe dun ta etiubo be tukpa te be eyena yina na
 Those who when they are admonished with the Signs of their Lord droop not down at them as if they were deaf or blind,To zanazhi aga sanatu be ayazhi yan Tsocia yin na e fe dun ta etiubo be tukpa te be eyena yina na
 And those who pray Our Lord! Grant unto us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes and give us the grace to lead the righteous,To zanazhie gangan Tsoci yi! Twayirya be yangbanfae be yangban taciny dagan mini iyaaliyizhio to zuriya yizhi wyo mao la yi-yio fe yesan-wangi ya zanazhie sundan Soko na
Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven because of their patient constancy therein shall they be met with salutations and peace,Zawuncinzhi aa gaagba be emiko wangizhii ebo hakuri naa jin na amaa daguna be emisa wangiy be amincy
 Dwelling therein- how beautiful an abode and place of rest!,Amaa fibo fi tutun yin edunfeba be kinigiba wunciny wuna gye sarauyin
Say to the Rejecters My Lord is not uneasy because of you if ye call not on Him But ye have indeed rejected Him and soon will come the inevitable punishment!Gangan ,Ki Tsoci mi gaajin damuwa be ye yino kaujin ebo aduwa ibada na ye jin naa yino Akika ma ye-yea alamari Soko yi ganmana be le yin ma azabaU ma gaajin tiile ta eti yebo

These are verses of the Book that makes things clear,Wuncin ayazhi ayio ya Litafi ALKURANU nazhi yi gbangba na
It may be thou frettest thy soul with grief that they do not become Believers,Wyo cie jin ke wyoga rayi wyo jin hallaka na ebo na ajin imania na
 If such were Our Will We could send down to them from the sky a Sign to which they would bend their necks in humility,Uga bayi Yia cin aya ndoci be yaa dagan sanmao kpaataama ciga kpatsu ta ya zankpe Soko
 But there comes not to them a newlyrevealed Message from Allah Most Gracious but they turn away therefrom,Ama laa de gangba woro na be yaa dagan eba Soko ALRAHMANUO na lea saide agaa pan keu lugwa
They have indeed rejected the Message so they will know soon enough the truth of what they mocked at!,Hakika a alamari Soko yi ganmana to bele yin labari zoba emi nazhie la naaa dabe yaa
 Do they not look at the earth how many noble things of all kinds We have produced therein,Kashi acin kin cin lea dokundokun yie nyin yangici sunsunzhi tinya dagan iri wangiwangi zhio
Verily in this is a Sign but most of them do not believe,Akika mini wuncino egwawu yan zankpe Soko danbo amaade ekundondoazhi ajin imania
And verily thy Lord is He the Exalted in Might Most Merciful,Akika ma Tsoci wyoe Wyun gayi Etsu zankpeo wyunnga mayi Etsu yeguno
Behold thy Lord called Moses Go to the people of iniquity,Wyo mao pa kamina Tsoci wyo yi Musa na Uci ganu gan Fe lo eba jamaa yan azwalumi wuncinzhi

 My breast will be straightened And my speech may not go smoothly so send unto Aaron,Yangban mi mae laa yiku to gintara mi maa lukpin Ebo acino tunafi Haruna eboupa mi baci
And further they have a charge of crime against me and I fear they may slay me,Amade lefi ndoci nami jin acie laa wa mi za na ebo acino mie sundan abea mi wu ma

So go forth both of you to Pharaoh and say ´We have been sent by the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds,Efe lo eba Firuna yemae ganugan Yi tuci yi yio yan Tsoci nae kpa alitazhi kpaata na
´Send thou with us the Children of Israel´,Kede wyo yo la Bani Israilazhio yao ya yi na

 And this is the favour with which thou dost reproach me that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel!,Niima wuncin ma na wyoe laasamizhina uyi ebo na wyoa banu Israilazhi kufi bautao na
Pharaoh said And what is the ´Lord and Cherisher of the worlds´,Firauna gan ZiI mae ye RABILALAMINAO Etsu nae kpa alitazhi nao
Moses said The Lord and Cherisher of the heavens and the earth and all between if ye want to be quite sure,UganEtsu nae kpa sanmazhi to kin to yannazhi fi tacinabo na wunayi hakika eza gaskiya yeyio na
 Pharaoh said to those around Did ye not listen to what he says,Firauna cie gan be zanazhi mauba na ganNgba ye wo yanna wyune gan naaSurah Moses said Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning!Musa ganTsoci ye to Tsoci yanmanciye yan mafaarizhi

Moses said Lord of the East and the West and all between! if ye only had sense!,M u s a c I g a n  Tsoci na wun igidi laba to igidi lo ba na to yannazhi fi tacinabo na wunayi hakika eza hankalizhi ye yio na
Pharaoh said If thou dost put forward any god other than me I will certainly put thee in prison! F I r  a u n a  g a n   ,Wyo ma ga kara ci jin bauta ya Tsoci ndoci zunma mibo to akika migao wan daa kan dan
Moses said Even if I showed you something clear and convincing,Musa ganAsa mibo ya wyoe be hujja yan gbangba yina
Pharaoh said Show it then if thou tellest the truth!,Firauna ganTo laube ya yi wuna yi mini zaba gaskiya zhi bo wyo dano na
Pharaoh said Show it then if thou tellest the truth!,Firauna ganTo laube ya yi wuna yi mini zaba gaskiya zhi bo wyo dano na
So Moses threw his rod and behold it was a serpent plain for all to see!,Gancin Musa cia tsunkunu ce cici edagao ufe zhe ewako ci fiilio
 And he drew out his hand and behold it was white to all beholders!,Uci kezhea egwau wa tinya ucia zhe bokun nae ban na fi zanazhie cinu le na
Pharaoh said to the Chiefs around him This is indeed a sorcerer wellversed,Firauna ci gan be majalisauzhi nazhie mau kezhe na gan Akika za nana eyanmanci uyio na de kpikpe na

 His plan is to get you out of your land by his sorcery then what is it ye counsel,Wyune kpakpa gan wyunu la yeyeu yanu tinu ya dagan kin yan be eyan manu yin ngba ki yedea gano

 And bring up to thee all our sorcerers wellversed,A maa bea ya wyoe be egba yan eyan mancizhi nazhi kpe eyan ma ye na
So the sorcerers were got together for the appointment of a day wellknown,Acia eyanma cizhi kuye kan zhizhi dan lokaci yan efo na yi tsitsaci nae
And the people were told Are ye now assembled,Aci fe gan ya zawangi zhi to zandondou tinuyaulo gungun yekanba
That we may follow the sorcerers in religion if they win,Ebo ma yiI la miitu eyan macizhi wunayi aga de zankpeo na
 So when the sorcerers arrived they said to Pharaoh Of courseshall we have a suitable reward if we win,Kamina eyanmacizhi bea gun yekan na aganNgba yiade laada ndoci wunayi yi ga de zankpeo na
 He said Yea and more for ye shall in that case be raised to posts nearest to my person f I r a u n a  c I g a n  ,E ba hakikama ye gaa fe dan mini eza tsonbazhio
 Moses said to them Throw yethat which ye are about to throw!,Musa cia gana gan Yandondo na ye ga dea ce na efe ceu
So they threw their ropes and their rods and said By the might of Pharaoh it is we who will certainly win!,Aci fe ce egbanazhi to tsukunazhi a ci gan  Be zankpe yan Firaunae hakika yi gaade zankpe
 Then Moses threw his rod when behold it straightway swallows up all the falsehoods which they fake!,Gancin Musa cia tsukunu ce cici edagao ma ufe tun kaaya ganmangizhi nyin
Then did the sorcerers fall down prostrate in adoration,Kpaata eyanmacizhi ci daa kin aci fe jin sujada
 Then did the sorcerers fall down prostrate in adoration,Kpaata eyanmacizhi ci daa kin aci fe jin sujada
 Saying We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,AganYia imani jin be Tsoci nae kpa alitazhi kpaata nae
The Lord of Moses and Aaron,Tsoci yan Musa be Harunae
 Said Pharaoh Believe ye in Him before I give you permission surely he is your leader who has taught you sorcery! but soon shall ye know! Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and I will cause you all to die on the cross!,UganYia imani jin beu yin shidzo tun mi laa ya ye izinia Akika wyun ga yi nunsa ye na wu ye eyanma nao ye ma gaa kpe yinna Akika miga egwa yezhi to bici yezhi ko ya leba dozhi mi ma gae fosa baenio

Only our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults that we may become foremost among the believers!,Akika yi mae bavun gan Tsoci yi Wyuna jin gaafara bicicin yizhi toto na yi yia zhe mafaari zanazhia imani jin na
By inspiration we told Moses Travel by night with my servants for surely ye shall be pursued,Yima jin wahayi ya Musa gan A tinya yeshi be wuzhi Mizhiakika ezazhia lamitu ye zunmao
Then Pharaoh sent heralds to all the Cities,Firauna cia ezazhi tundaa zhinin ebo ekunguncizhia laa guna yekan
Saying These Israelites are but a small band,Firauna ganHakika zananazhi jamaazhi ayio na dokuna na
 And they are raging furiously against us,Ezazhi ma ayio nazhie zhe yi wun na

So We expelled them from gardens springs,Gancin Yicia yan dzun tinya dagan batakoazhio be nuwan managiazhi
Treasures and every kind of honourable position,Ganni be edzunbako arzikizhi be edunfeba yan alfarmazhi i
Thus it was but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things,Acinga gau yioYicia laa gigun ya Banu Israilazhi
 Thus it was but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things,Acinga gau yioYicia laa gigun ya Banu Israilazhi
So they pursued them at sunrise,Acia mi tua aci daa tso lokaci igidie la tin ya nae
 And when the two bodies saw each other the people of Moses said We are sure to be overtaken,Kamina jamaa gubaba bea dozhi leye na jamaa yan Musa cigan Hakika zannzhi gayi tso re!
Moses said By no means! my Lord is with me! Soon will He guide me!,Musa ganAa ujin acina akika Tsoci mi dan be mi yin Umaa wu yi ba eko gwagan
 Then We told Moses by inspiration Strike the sea with thy rod So it divided and each separate part became like the huge firm mass of a mountain,Gancin Yici jin wahyi fi Musa ganA tsukun wyoe laadan edu edagao ma edufe lafi kansan ndondo cia zhe ke pati wancikoko na

 And that they say what they practise not,Acia jin afe da ganzhi gan yan etun na atsoe loa na
Except those who believe work righteousness engage much in the remembrance of Allah and defend themselves only after they are unjustly attacked And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take!Sai de zanazhi ga imani jin na acie lo tun wangiwangizhi na aci tun Soko ye dokun aci wa taimako Soko eti jinjin gao baaci na aajin zwalunci na Bele yin ma zanazhi jin zwalunci na aa be kpe iri ezhe keba nagaayi ezhekebaa na,
These are verses of the Qur´an-a book that makes things clear,TWAU SIN Wuncinzhi aya Alkuranu ayio be Litafi natso yi gbangba na
A guide and glad tidings for the believers-Bawu uyio be bushaara yangbanfae ya muminizhi,
 and also have full assurance of the hereafterZanazhie ku salla gikini na amae la zakka dukiyaazhi wa amaa gaskiya ya be Efo zobae na,
As to those who believe not in the Hereafter We have made their deeds pleasing in their eyes and so they wander about in distraction,Akika zanazhie jin imani be Efo zoba yina na Yia etun dedeazhi panin fia acia jin afe pe fi bo
 Such are they for whom a grievous Penalty is waiting and in the Hereafter theirs will be the greatest loss,Zawuncinzhi azaba dede gaajin tabbat yaa Efo zobae ma agaafe dan mini zanazhi jin asaara sarauyin na
As to thee the Qur´an is bestowed upon thee from the presence of one who is wise and all-knowing,Akika ma e la Alkuranu labe ya wyoe dagan eba Soko nayi Egbako Umayi Etsu kpikpe na
Behold! Moses said to his family I perceive a fire soon will I bring you from there some information or I will bring you a burning brand to light our fuel that ye may warm yourselves,Wyo mao pa kamina Musa fe gan be iyaliu yin na kede akika mi taye le ena ye mia tunbo ebo-nla labari-n-benyaye ko ma mia-be be ena cikarae ebo ye de enae ye
But when he came to the fire a voice was heard Blessed are those in the fire and those around and glory to Allah the Lord of the worlds,Lokaci na u tun bo na aci yiu gan Albarkaajin tabbata ya zana gi eba enao na to zanazhi mau -- ba na Lil kpaata maajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu naekpa alitazhi kpata na
,
Now do thou throw thy rod! But when he saw it moving of its own accordas if it had been a snake he turned back in retreat and retraced not his steps O Moses! it was said Fear not truly in My presence those called as messengers have no fear-,Wyo mao la tsukun wyo yo o ceo cici To kamina uleu ye cife kun ke ewa-ko na wyuna zunma zheta uma zheban cin zunmale bea Soko ci gan Ya wyoe Musa! Ga sundan ma akika Mi Tucizhie sundan gi eba Mi boa
But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take the place of evil truly I am Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de zana ga eti tacinu jin zwalunci na Gancin ugabea etun wangizhi laa sangwa etun dedezhi na to akika Mi Etsu gafara Mi yio Etsu yegun
Now put thy hand into thy bosom and it will come forth white without stain or harm these are among the nine Signs thou wilt take to Pharaoh and his people for they are a people rebellious in transgression,Wyo mao la egwa wyo yo o ganodan nin yan ewo-wyo bo ugaa tinya bokun wangii na made egun ndondoa na wuncin yi nini mini aya gutunani naa tunfi Firauna to jamaa yanuzhi na Akika aafe jamaa nazhi yi fasikizhi na
But when Our Signs came to them that should have opened their eyes they said This is sorcery manifest!,To Lokaci na aya gbangba yan Yizhi be yaa na agan Nana eyan ma uyio na yi gbangba na
And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance though their souls were convinced thereof so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly!,Aci gbomi beayin eti zwalincio be etin yele alaalima yangbanatsozhia gaskiya ya beu yin Wyo mao cinole kendoe zoba zanazhie nyin yan na yiyi na
We gave in the past knowledge to David and Solomon And they both said Praise be to Allah Who has favoured us above many of his servants who believe!,Akika ma Yi la ilimi kpikpe ya Daawuda to Sulaimanu za gubaabaa ci gan Yebo kpataa jin tabbata ya Soko na yayi daraja ta eti ekundondo mini wuzhiUzhio nazhi yi muminizhi nao
And Solomon was David´s heir He said O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds and on us has been bestowed a little of all things this is indeed Grace manifest from Allah,Sulaymanu ci bea gigun yan Dawuda uci gan Ya ye zawangizhi! A wu-yi yekpe egan elugizhi ama la yandondo yayi yan mulki Akika nana Ugayi daraja naa tula nao
And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts- of Jinns and men and birds and they were all kept in order and ranks,Acia jamaa kagbocizhi ku yekan zhizhi ya Sulaymanu dagan mini aljanizhio to zawangizhi to elugizhi acia jin shiri wangi ya etun ndondo
At length when they came to a lowly valley of ants one of the ants said O ye ants get into your habitations lest Solomon and his hosts crush you under foot without knowing it,Har kamina atun kpankoro yan wuryabya-zhi na wuryabya nini ci gan Ya ye wuryabyazhi! Yea gadan kataezhio ebo Sulayman be jamaa kagbociuzhii be dae ma alaalima aa kpea ma
Uci jin bincike wiwa za yan elugizhi uci gan Ki la mici le Hudahuda yea yino kashi wyuna fe dan mini zanazhi danboa nao,
 So he smiled amused at her speech and he said O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee And admit me by Thy Grace to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants,Uci yi-tsan-ma ebo eganubo uci gan Tsoci mi! Twami rya be foro na mi gaajin yebo ya niima wyozhi nazhi wyo la ya mi to yanmanci mizhi na mi manlanfe zanae lotun wangizhi na wyoajin yeda be yin-nae Wyo mao la mio lao ganodan mini wuzhi guru wyo zhio be yegun wyo yin
And he took a muster of the Birds and he said Why is it I see not the Hoopoe Or is he among the absentees,Uci jin bincike wiwa za yan elugizhi uci gan Ki la mici le Hudahuda yea yino kashi wyuna fe dan mini zanazhi danboa nao
I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty or execute him unless he bring me a clear reason for absence,Akika be Sokoe sai mi gaujin azaba na tsun na ko ma be Sokoe migau zun koma wyuntsou be be dalili na gboka nae
 But the Hoopoe tarried not far he came up and said I have compassed territory which thou hast not compassed and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true,Edagao uyi be kpalo ndoci yina wyuna fedun uci gan Mida le yandoci ye na wyolaa kpea na mima be be ya wyoe be labari yan gaskiyae dagan kin yan SABAIO
 I found there a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite and she has a magnificent throne,Akika mida tsun yinzagi ndoci nae jina mulki na ama ya wyuntso yandondo yan mulki jin uma yi be gado sarauta na wancin na
pleasing in their eyes and has kept them away from the Path- so they receive no guidance-,Mi da tsunu to jamaa yanuzhi e jin sujada ya igidi ke Soko lugwa Shetan cia etun dedeazhi panin fia ucia kan eko gaskiya-yin-da acia fe zanazhie ke eko wangia na
 I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes and has kept them away from the Path- so they receive no guidance-,Mi da tsunu to jamaa yanuzhi e jin sujada ya igidi ke Soko lugwa Shetan cia etun dedeazhi panin fia ucia kan eko gaskiya-yin-da acia fe zanazhie ke eko wangia na
 Kept them away from the Path that they should not worship Allah Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what ye hide and what ye reveal,Kiala acia jin sujada ya Soko Etsu nae wa eyan swiswoci tinya dagan sanmazhio to kinboa naa yino U ma yi be kpikpe yannazhi ye swo kpaata na to yannazhi ye tu la na
Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!,Soko ade yandoci ko zandoci naajin bauta ya naa sai de wyuny Etsu Alarashi na wancin na
 Solomon said Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!Sulaymanu ci gan ,To yia cin labariole wunayi gaskiya wyo tao ko ma wyo afe dan mini ganmana zunci zhio
Go thou with this letter of mine and deliver it to them then draw back from them and wait to see what answer they return,A takada wasika mi nana laadaa wyocio la wuno lao yaa wyo cio zhin zunma de gi gancin wyo cio cinole kia yi ezhe banazhio
The queen said Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy of respect,Ucigan Ya ye majalisazhi! Akika ala wasika ndoci be yami na ma wancin na
Mini u bo agan Akika dagan eba Sulaymanu bo ufe beo akika mi maaca be sunna Sokoe Etsu tosayi Etsu yegun,
 ´Be ye not arrogant against me but come to me in submission to the true Religion´,Ega kaara la tidanfino ya mi ma ye mae be tsunmi eti kpatsun ta ya alamari Soko
She said Ye chiefs! advise me in this my affair no affair have I decided except in your presence,Sarauniyan ci gan Ya ye majalisazhi! E yan shaawara dan alamari mi nanao ebo na miaba shaawara ndondo tia sai ye ga danbo
 They said We are endued with strength and given to vehement war but the command is with thee so consider what thou wilt command,Agan Yide kagbocizhi yiyio yi ma yi ekunguncizhi nazhi gboka sarauyin na alamari de kpata fi gwa wyobo wyo mao cin-wunole ebo iri foro na wyogaa la yayi nao
 She said Kings when they enter a country despoil it and make the noblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave,Uci gan Akika Etsu zhi kandondo na agaa gandan alkarya ndocio na aajin e lau nyin ya baenio aciga nunsa ezhizhi laazhe eza gbigbacizhi acinga gama e jinjino
But I am going to send him a present and wait to see with what answer return my ambassadors,Akika ma miga eryatwa ndoci laa tun za fia mi cinfen cinle kiayi ezhe na tucizhia la zhin nao
 Now when the embassy came to Solomon he said Will ye give me abundance in wealth But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!,Kamina tuci dazhin eba Sulaymanu na Sulaymanu gan Dukiya ga yede gan yea la yami yino ngan yanna Soko la ya mi na wunace yan na Ula ya ye na Aa yede ejin fahri be eryatwa ye yin
Go back to them and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet We shall expel them from there in disgrace and they will feel humbled indeed,A eryatwaa la zheban da yaa wyo mao gano yaa kede akika yia be yaa be ekunguncizhii na ma aa gikini wo be yina na akika ma yigaa wadzun tinya dagan kin wuncino be zunyesuny ama gaafe eza gbigbacizhi eza gbagbangizhi
He said to his own men Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission,Sulaymanu ci gan Ya ye majalisazhi Zii miniebo aada la gado mulki be ya mi yino kafi atsoabe ata kpatsun nao
Said an ´Ifrit of the Jinns I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council indeed I have full strength for the purpose and may be trustedEza bididi ndoci mini jannuzhio ci gan Mia lau be ya wyoe kaafi wyo-yo naokin majalisao na akika ma kagboci miyio eza amaana ma miyi eti jin jin wuncin bo,
Said one who had knowledge of the Book I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye! Then when Solomon saw it placed firmly before him he said This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful truly his gratitude is a gain for his own soul but if any is ungrateful truly my Lord is Free of all Needs Supreme in Honour !,Zandoci na yi be ilimi yan Litafiina ci gan Mia lau be ya wyoe kaafiobaye na! E dana u leu ye shishi cin-yin yegboroubo na ugan Nana falala uyio dagan eba Tsoci mibo ebo Uu ma miucinule yebo miajino kashi kafirinci miajino zana ma ga jin yebo na ebo tiubo zana ma gajin kafirinci na to akika Tsoci mi Etsu bagwo Uyio Cinwanci Uyio
 He said Transform her throne out of all recognition by her let us see whether she is guided to the truth or is one of those who receive no guidance,Uci ganYea gado mulki laabe yanfiu ugau kpeye kashi u gaa fedan mini zanazhia kpeu yea nao
 So when she arrived she was asked Is this thy throne She said It was just like this and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this and we have submitted to Allah in Islam,To lokaci na ube na acia ganu ganNgba aninga ga gado wyo yio U ci gan Wyoa ye gan ko wun-gao ni Sulaymanu cigan Ama yayi ilimi shiudzo yi maafe musulumizhi
 And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah for she was sprung of a people that had no faith,Yanna ma wyune jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa na wyunu kan imani yin-jin akika wyunafe dan mini kafirizhio
She was asked to enter the lofty Palace but when she saw it she thought it was a lake of water and she tucked up her skirts uncovering her legs He said This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass She said O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul I do now submit in Islam with Solomon to the Lord of the Worlds,Aci ganugan A gandan nko Etsuo kamina uleuye na uye gan ko nuwanuyio na shiko sarau yin na ucia ede vokpau ka Sulaymanu ci gan Akika emi tsu nana titaci uyio naa jin be kpalaba ba yele zhiina U gan Ya wyoe Tsoci mi! Akika mia eti tacin mi jin zwalunci mimaa kpatsun ta ya Tsoci nae kpa alitazhi kpaata na ganni be Sulaymanuy
 We sent aforetime to the Thamud their brother Salih saying Serve Allah But behold they became two factions quarrelling with each other,Akika Yima tun fi Samuduzhi ugayi yegia Salihuo kede E jin bauta ya Soko Acia ganfi ena guba naejin husuma be dozhii na
He said O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to the good If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness ye may hope to receive mercy,Ugan Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! Ki la ye cie dinye wa egagba etun dede shi egagba etun wangi dzoo Kiila yecia wa gaafara Sokoa yino ujin wo aa guna ye
 They said Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee He said Your ill omen is with Allah yea ye are a people under trial,Agan Yie taye cin wyole ke ekpa eyan dedezhi na to wyoe to zanazhie pama be wyoyin na uci gan Ekpa eyan dede nazhie tswane na eba Soko bo udano Aa ye de ezazhi ye yio na e ma-cinle na
 There were in the city nine men of a family who made mischief in the land and would not reform,Amade dan zhinin bo jamaa gutunani ndocizhi nazhie nyin yan fi kinbo na a mae gye yana
 They said Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people and that we shall then say to his heir when he seeks vengeance ´We were not present at the slaughter of his people and we are positively telling the truth´,Aci gan E zhi kuti be Sokoe kede akika yi gau wu be yeshii to iyaliuzhi gancin yicia gan ya egungiciuzhi gan Yi dan ba na awu iyaaliuzhi naa ni Yima akika gaskiya tacizhi yi yio
They plotted and planned but We too planned even while they perceived it not,Acia tanadi pa Yi tso ma jin shiri yan nyin-nyin na yia nyina tanadi ya na a ma kpea
Then see what was the end of their plot!- this that We destroyed them and their people all of them,Wyo mao cinole kendoe zoba yan tanadi dedeazhi be yi na akika Yia tanfi to jamaa yanazhi baenio
Now such were their houses - in utter ruin - because they practised wrong-doing Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge,Emiazhi zhio na kpaata gbingbin yacizhi ebo zwalunci nazhi afe jin nae Akika mini wuncino egwa wu zankpe Soko danbo ya zanazhi ga yi eza kpikpe zhi na
And We saved those who believed and practised righteousnessYicia zanazhia imani jin na wadzun amaafe zanazhie sundan Soko na,
ugh ye see its iniquity,To Lutu kamina u gan ya jamaa yanuzhi na Ye da loyun swakwa yetso mae le ba ye
Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women Nay ye are a people grossly ignorant!,Ye da wo shahawa be bagizhi ke yinzagizhi lugwa ye de eza ti zhiko ye yio
But his people gave no other answer but this they said Drive out the followers of Lut from your city these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!,Egan ndondo tinya misun jamaa yanuzhi boa saide Yea jamaa yan Lutuzhi ku dzun tinya dagan alkaryaebo akika eza zhiayio nazhie wa lili na
 But his people gave no other answer but this they said Drive out the followers of Lut from your city these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!,Egan ndondo tinya misun jamaa yanuzhi boa saide Yea jamaa yan Lutuzhi ku dzun tinya dagan alkaryaebo akika eza zhiayio nazhie wa lili na
But We saved him and his family except his wife her We destined to be of those who lagged behind,Yiciu wadzun to iyaliuzhi sai de yinminu na Yia wyun ka dan mini eza hallakazhio na
 And We rained down on them a shower of brimstone and evil was the shower on those who were admonished but heeded not!,Yici dule azaba kpea akika ele azaba wuncin wuna biye ya zanazhi ajin gangba aci wo gana na
 Say Praise be to Allah and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen for his Message Who is better- Allah or the false gods they associate with Him,Gangan Yebo kpataajin tabbata ya Soko aminci maajin tabbata ta eti wuzhiUzhio nazhi yi eza tsitsacizhi na Ngba Soko ga -- yin gan naa wun nao kashi kuti nazhi e laa paU baci na

Or Who has created the heavens and the earth and Who sends you down rain from the sky Yea with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full of beauty of delight it is not in your power to cause the growth of the trees in them Can there be another god besides Allah Nay they are a people who swerve from justice,Ngba zii jin alita sanmazhi to kin yino U cie dule yaye dagan sanmabo Yi cia yangici sun-sunzhi laatinya dan bata nazhi yi wangizhi na ye made kagbo na yea la cingbanuzhi tinya naa yino Ngba ade Tsoci ndoci nae pama be Sokoe na Aa adea fe jamaa nazhie laa pan ke gaskiya lugwa na

It is true we were promised this- we and our fathers before us these are nothing but tales of the ancientsAkika ajin yi alkawali iri nanazhi leani to yi to yanmanci yizhi Nana de fea saide ecin yan za paayin zhi,
 Say Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty of sin,Gan yaa gan E dazan kpe eti kinbo ye mae cinele kendoe zoba yan lefi jincizhi yi yi na

 But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind Yet most of them are ungrateful,Akika ma Tsoci wyo Etsu eryatwa Uyio ya zawangizhi amaade ekun dondoazhi e jin ye boa
 And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide As well as all that they reveal,Akika Tsoci wyo ma Uyi be kpikpe yannazhi e swo fi yangbanazhio na to yannazhi e la ke fiili na
Nor is there aught of the unseen in heaven or earth but is recorded in a clear record,Amade yandoci ko zandoci na swo dan sanmao to kinbo naa saide wunadan mini Litafi na yi gbangbana LAUHIL-MAHFUZ
Verily this Qur´an doth explain to the Children of Israel most of the matters in which they disagree,Akika Alkuranu nana wune ya Bani Israilazhi labari yan ekundondo yan nazhi ece dozhi leba fi miniubo naSurah  And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believeAkika ma bawu uyio be yeguny ya muminizhi
Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree and He is Exalted in Might All-Knowing,Akika ma Tsoci wyoe ga sharia jin tsakaniabo be hukunciUyin Wyun ga mayi Etsu zankpeo Etsu kpikpe
 So put thy trust in Allah for thou art on the path of manifest Truth,Ebo acino aa yakpe Soko akika wyo ta eti gaskiyao na ma yi gbangba na
Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen nor canst thou cause the deaf to hear the call especially when they turn back in retreat,Akika wyo la eza tsutsucizhi wo gan woa wyo ma la edingizhi wogan woa kamina aga zunma zheta cie daa daa naa
Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind to prevent them from straying only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs and they will bow in Islam,Wyo ma la yeboncizhi ke eko wo baaci na aa gbina ni naa Wyo la zando wo gan woa sai de zana gae jin imani be aya Yizhi na gancin acie la kpatsun ta ya foro Soko na
And when the Word is fulfilled against them the unjust we shall produce from the earth a beast to face them He will speak to them for that mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs,Kamina ma alkawali na Yi jinana gaa gun na to Yia la dabba ndoci tinya yaa dagan kinbo ucia fe gangan yaa gan Akika ekun dondo zawangizhi e ya gaskiya be aya Yizhi yina
 One day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those who reject our Signs and they shall be kept in ranks-,Wyo mao pa Efo na Yi gaa la kukuyeka dan mini jamaa ndondo ona zanazhie la aya Yizhi ganmana na aci gaa bokeba be dozhii
Until when they come before the Judgment-seat Allah will say Did ye reject My Signs though ye comprehended them not in knowledge or what was it ye did,Har kamina aga bea dzun be na Soko cia gana gan Beke yea aya Mizhi yi ganmana na ye ma mau kezhe be kpikpe ndondo yina kashi kiyi iri etun nazhi yefe lo izheo nao
And the Word will be fulfilled against them because of their wrong-doing and they will be unable to speak in plea,Alkawali azaba na Soko jina na cia cin ta etiabo ebo zwalunci na afe jin na amaa gangan ndondo woa
 See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day to give them light Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe!,Kashi aleye gan Yia yeshi jin yaa na aafe shi yangbanta gun naa to batin igidi cia she be haske naa Akika ngan mini wuncino ayazhi danbo ya zanazhi gae jin imani na
 And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten with terror those who are in the heavens and those who are on earth except such as Allah will please to exempt and all shall come to His Presence as beings conscious of their lowliness,To fona agaa be fe fi mini kafo na to yandondo nafi sanmazhio to kinbo na gaa wa-do saide zana ga ba Soko uci waka na Kpaata ma aa lo ebaU lo be kpatsun tae be egba gbae
Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away such is the artistry of Allah who disposes of all things in perfect order for he is well acquainted with all that ye do,Wyo maa fe cin patizhi le wyoa ye ganko baeni boa gio alaalima e dazan da iri ezanda yan girgije Etun Soko ga dano nao Etsu naa yandondo jin wangi na Akika Soko yi be kpikpe etun nazhi ye lo na
If any do good good will accrue to them therefrom and they will be secure from terror that Day,Zaeni ndondo naga be be etun bolobolo ninii na wyunade egagba alheri na ganuna ama gaade aminci Fo wuncin ke edo lugwa
 And if any do evil their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds ,Zaeni ndondo nama gabe be etun dedeena agaa fuskazhi zhekpe enao Ngan gbata wo ndoci danbo ya aa sai de yan etun nazhi alona
 For me I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom belong all things and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Islam to Allah´s Will-,Akika de ajin mi foro gan min jin bautanya Tsoci yan ezhi nana makka nayi ezhi alfurma na Wyun ga ma wun yandondo amajin mi foro gan minla fen dan mini musulumizhio
And to rehearse the Qur´an and if any accept guidance they do it for the good of their own souls and if any stray say I am only a Warner,Ama jin mi foro gan min fen gba Alkuranu gancin zana ga bea ke eko na to akika uke eko ke ya eti tacinu zana ma ga bea gbin na to gan yau gan kon daa maa mini gangba jincizhi bo mi dano
And say Praise be to Allah Who will soon show you His Signs so that ye shall know them and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do,Wyo mao gan gan Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko bele yin ma Wyunala zankpeUzhi wue yetso maa kpeaye Tsoci wyo mafe Etsu naa yaye ke etun nazhie lo na lugwaa

We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth for people who believe,Yie gba ya wyoe dagan mini labari Musa be Firaunae be gaskiyae ebo ualufe bibe imaniuya muminizhi
Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections depressing a small group among them their sons he slew but he kept alive their females for he was indeed a maker of mischief,Akika Firaunaa gbintu ta eti kinbo ucia jamaazhi safi kpere-kpere ucie yibaba zandocizhi miniabo ufe zun egi bagiazhi ucie la egi yinzagizhi lugwa Akika wyunafe dan mini zanazhie nyin-yan nae
And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land to make them leaders in Faith and make them heirs,Yimaa kpa gan Yia twarya ya zanazhi e yiba baa dan kinbo na Yima-y-laae la-y-fe dzoshicizhi Yi ma-y-laae lay-fe egungicizhi yan mulki na Firaunae jin na
To establish a firm place for them in the land and to show Pharaoh Haman and their hosts at their hands the very things against which they were taking precautions,Yima gaaya kagbo dan kinbo Yi ma gaa la wu Firauna to Hamana to ekunguciazhi zagu baaba iri yannazhi agae sundan beayin na
So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses Suckle thy child but when thou hast fears about him cast him into the river but fear not nor grieve for We shall restore him to thee and We shall make him one of Our messengers,Yima ci jin wahyi ya Nna yan Musa gan Uu ya be ye kamina wyo gae be sundan yau na to uu ce ta eduo wyo mao ga sundan ma wyo mao ga nyin yangban ma akika Yi gau lazhin bea ya wyoe Yi ma gau laafe dan mini Tucizhio
Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up from the river It was intended that Moses should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow for Pharaoh and Haman and all their hosts were men of sin,Za mi Firauna zhi ciu de la ebo zunma--  ubea zhe makiri be yangban nyiny yaa ma Akika Firauna to Hamana to ekungunciazhi aafe bicicincizhi
The wife of Pharaoh said Here is joy of the eye for me and for thee slay him not It may be that he will be use to us or we may adopt him as a son And they perceived not what they were doing!,Yinmi Firauna ci gan Egi nna yangban tacin uyio ya mi to wyoe ye mae ga wuu ma kengii uyio na wyuna jin yi anfani na ko ma yii la wyunila egi Ama kpe yanna Sokoa jin yanu naa
But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses She was going almost to disclose his case had We not strengthened her heart with faith so that she might remain a firm believer,Yangban yan Nna yan Musa cia fe foko-yin yandondo fibo sai yekpa eti Musao De gi keo kacana ugaa yanna dan beuyin na tula kagan ujin ebo yangban wu na Yi la danu yangbano naa ebo ma ulaufeo dan mini muminizhio
And she said to the sister of Moses Follow him so she the sister watched him in the character of a stranger And they knew not,Ucia gan ya yegiu yinzagi gan A mitu ekpau Uci taye leuye dagan ba kpaako ama kpegan yegiu uyia
And we ordained that he refused suck at first until His sister came up and said Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him,Tun shidzo batsozhio ma Yia ebe nuwan yan yinzagi nazhie yaabe ye na laajin haramu yau yegiu ci gan Ngba min wuyeba lo zaba emi ndocizhi nazhia yau be ye amaajin bolobolo beuyin na
 Thus did We restore him to his mother that her eye might be comforted that she might not grieve and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true but most of them do not understandYiciu la dazhin eba Nnau be ebo yangban wyunu cinu ta umau ga nyin yangban ma umau kpeu wo ke akika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio-na amaade ekundondoazhi a kpea,
 When he reached full age and was firmly established in life We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge for thus do We reward those who do good,Kamina ubea jin baligi na ucia gun za na Yi twaurya be hukunci ganni be ilimiy kpikpe acinga gama Yie la egagba ya zanazhi gae jin bolobolo nao
And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching and he found there two men fighting- one of his own religion and the other of his foes Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him He said This is a work of Evil Satan for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!,Uci daa gandan zhinin bo kanga ma zawangizhi kpea uci da tsun eza bagi guba ndocizhi nazhie sun-wun na zaeni dagan mini kabilau bo udano zabaci nana ma mini nazhie sunwun beuyin na bo udano Gancin natso yi kabila nini beuyin na ciwa wuceu ta eti natso yi ewunsuncia na Musa ci dau gwa Nanade mini etun shetan bo uyio akika shetan makiri uyio zana mae gbinza na uyio yan gbangba
He prayed O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me! So Allah forgave him for He is the Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Ugan Tsoci mi! Akika mia eti tacin mi jin zwalunci wyode fa be mi yin Soko ma ci fa beuyin akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun Uyio
 He said O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me never shall I be a help to those who sin!,Ugan Tsoci mi! Be iri niima nazhi wyola ya mi nae mia fe zanaejin lefi jincizhi taimako naa
 So he saw the morning in the city looking about in a state of fear when behold the man who had the day before sought his help called aloud for his help again Moses said to him Thou art truly it is clear a quarrelsome fellow!,Ucia tinba gun zhininbo ufe sundan yangban mae yan-yan ko kia be jino gancin nda na wa taimako beuyin tsuwo na wyune ke yeuyi be Musa cia ganu gan Wyode eza egbin wyo yio naa tula na
Then when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them that man said O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent man in the land and not to be one who sets things right!,To kamina Musa kpagan wyunasun natso yi makiri na egwao na natsoe wa taimako na ci gan Wyoe Musa! Wyoe kpakpa gan wyo la mi yino wu kendoe wyo wuza tsuwo na Ade yanna wyoe kpa naa saide wyo lao zhe yangban kagbociodan kinbo wyo ma kpa gan wyo lao feo dan mini za guru zhi boa
 And there came a man running from the furthest end of the City He said O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee to slay thee so get thee away for I do give thee sincere advice,Eza bagi ndoci mumini mini jamaa yan Firauna zhio cia tinya dagan ba kpaako yan zhi ninbo ucife dinye uci gan Wyoe Musa! Akika majalisa yan zhi-zhi adanbo ejin shaawara eti wyobo ebo ala wyo-yaa wu ebo acino a tinya akika miafe dan mini zanazhie jin wo gangba nao
He therefore got away therefrom looking about in a state of fear He prayed O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing,Ucia tinya dagan miniubo be dasuny ucie cin bazhi le elo be zhiny ugan Tsoci mi! Wa mi dzun dagan egun jamaa yan azwalumizhio
 Then when he turned his face towards the land of Madyan he said I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path,Kamina ulaye wu kansanta yan Madyana na ugan Mie jin kauna gan Tsoci mi wyuna wu mi ba lo eko natso yi daidai na
And when he arrived at the watering place in Madyan he found there a group of men watering their flocks and besides them he found two women who were keeping back their flocks He said What is the matter with you They said We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take back their flocks And our father is a very old man,Kamina ufe kpan lo eba nuwan -- ga Madyana na uci da tsun jamaa zhi dokun zhi bagao e ya dabbazhi nuwan fin uci ke tsun yinzagi guba ndocizhi kansantaabo e yan dabba zhi uci ganagan Kii jin ye yio A cigan yia ya dabba yizhi nuwan fina sai de dabba kpaci nanazhi gaa sajin be dzo Baba yi ma wyuna kuku sarauyin
So he watered their flocks for them then he turned back to the shade and saidO my Lord! truly am I in desperate need of any good that Thou dost send me!,Ucia dabbazhi ya nuwan fin yaa ucia zheban daa wuru ndoci uci gan Tsoci mi! Eza bukaata mi yio lo eba alheri ndondo na wyo gaa cin be ya mi na
Afterwards one of the damsels came back to him walking bashfully She said My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered our flocks for us So when he came to him and narrated the story he said Fear thou not well hast thou escaped from unjust people,Zaeni mini yinzagi guba wuncinzhio ci da be ebau uci fe dazan be zunye ucigan Akika Baba mie yi wyoe ebo ula egagba nuwan na wyo ya dabba yizhi fin nauya wyoe To lokaci na u tunbau na wyunu ya labari kpaata ucia ganu gan Ga sundan ma wyoa gangwaani be egun yan azwalumi zhiy
 Said one of the damsels O my dear father! engage him on wages truly the best of men for thee to employ is the man who is strong and trusty,Zaeni mini egi yinzagi wuncinzhio ci gan Baba uula egi tuny akika ade zana -- yin gan na wyoa la tun naa sai zana gboka uma yi eza amaana na
 He said I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee on condition that thou serve me for eight years but if thou complete ten years it will be grace from thee But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty thou wilt find me indeed if Allah wills one of the righteous,Ucia gan ya Musa gan Mie kpa gan min jin yawon ya wyoe be egi mi nini mini zagubaaba nazhi zhi daa na eti etun na wyoa lo ya mi yan eya gutota na gancin wyo ga beu gun eya guwo to wuncin yi etsa yan ti tacin wyotso mi ma kpa gan minla bayiba ndocin ta wyo yaa wyo maa tsun mi ugaa ba Soko na mini za guruzhio nazhie she alkawali na
He said Be that the agreement between me and thee whichever of the two terms I fulfil let there be no ill-will to me Be Allah a witness to what we say,Musa ci gan Wuncin de yi tsakani mi bo be wyo yin mini eka gubaabao ndondo na miga be jin na gbin gbintu ndoci ta eti mi boa Soko gama yi eri tsakani yibo eti yannazhi yie gan nao
Now when Moses had fulfilled the term and was travelling with his family he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur He said to his family Tarry ye I perceive a fire I hope to bring you from there some information or a burning firebrand that ye may warm yourselves,To kamina Musa bea etun lozo dan lokaci bibacio na wyuna tinya dan zano be iyaliu yin uci taye le ena ye kansanta pati yan TUURIO uci gan ya iyaaliu gan Yea fedun zhiabo akika mi taye le ena ye ebo acino mia tun bo ujin wo ko mia be yaye be labarii ko ma be ena cikara na yea de ye na
But when he came to the fire a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley from a tree in hallowed ground O Moses! Verily I am Allah the Lord of the Worlds,Kamina u tun bau na aci yiu dagan egwa gwaalo yan kpankoro dan danna albarka yan cigban wuncino Wyoe Musa! Akika Miga yi Sokoo Etsu naekpa alitazhi kpaata na
 Now do thou throw thy rod! but when he saw it moving of its own accord as if it had been a snake he turned back in retreat and retraced not his steps O Moses! It was said Draw near and fear not for thou art of those who are secure,Wyo mao la tsukun wyo yoo cici kamina uleu ye cie kun ke ewa na wyuna zunma zheta ci fe bici uma zheye bana Acia ganugan Wyoe Musa! Dazhin wyo mao ga sundan ma akika wyoa fedan mini eza aminci zhio
Move thy hand into thy bosom and it will come forth white without stain or harm and draw thy hand close to thy side to guard against fear Those are the two credentials from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Chiefs for truly they are a people rebellious and wicked,Wyo mao la egwa wyo yoo lao dan koro-ewo wyobo ugaa tinya bokuny na ma de egun ndondoa na wyo mao la egwao laoba kansan wyobo ebo dansun bokun boubo To gubaaba nanazhi hujjazhi ayio dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo lo eba Firauna to majalisauzhi akika aafe jamaa nazhi yi fasikizhi na
 He said O my Lord! I have slain a man among them and I fear lest they slay me,Musa gan Tsoci mi! Akika mi wu zandoci miniabo mimae sundan abea mi wu ma
And my brother Aaron - He is more eloquent in speech than I so send him with me as a helper to confirm and strengthen me for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood,Yegi mi Haruna ma ude fasaha gintara gan mi ebo acino Uu tun-tun ganni be mi yin ebou jin mi taimako umau ya mi gaskiya akika mie sundan gan aa bea egan mi yi ganmana
 He said We will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother and invest you both with authority so they shall not be able to touch you with Our Sign shall ye triumph- you two as well as those who follow you,U gan Yia beo kagbo be yegio yin Yi maa yae taimako aa tun ba ye wo be egun ndondo yina Efe lo be aya Yizhi to ye to zanazhia emi tu ye na ye ga wun zankpeo
 When Moses came to them with Our clear signs they said This is nothing but sorcery faked up never did we head the like among our fathers of old!,To kamina Musa be yaa be aya Yizhi gbangbae na agan  Nana de uyia sai de eyan ma naa tswa na yi ma laa wo iri nana le dan mini yanmanci yizhi yan mafarizhi boa
Moses said My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper,Musa ci gan Tsoci mi ade kpikpe gano yan zana be be bawuy dagan ebaUbo nao to zana gaade zoba wangi gan nao akika azwalumizhia tso guria
Pharaoh said O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself therefore O Haman! light me a kiln to bake bricks out of clay and build me a lofty palace that I may mount up to the god of Moses but as far as I am concerned I think Moses is a liar!,Firauna ci gan Ya ye majalisazhi! Mi kpe ya ye yede Tsoci ndoci zunma mi boa wyo ma Hamanu aa ena gun ya mi ta eti eguno naa agaa sa lankpa na wyo cio tubao ya mi lo fiti ebo mi danle Tsoci yan Musan ye akika mie jinu zato gan mini ganmana zuncizhi bo udano
 And he was arrogant and insolent in the land beyond reason- He and his hosts they thought that they would not have to return to Us!,Ucia gbotika to wyuny to ekun gunciuzhi ta eti kinbo umayi eti gaskiya boa acie kpaye gan aa zheban be tsun Yi yia
So We seized him and his hosts and We flung them into the sea Now behold what was the end of those who did wrong!,Yiciu wan to ekungunciuzhi Yi cia cegun mini eduo wyo mao cinole kendoe zoba azwalumizhie yi yi na
And we made them but leaders inviting to the Fire and on the Day of Judgment no help shall they find,Yicia laafe dzoshicizhi nazhe yi zazhi lo ena na Efo Alkiyamii ma aa de zanazhia jina taimako naa
in this world We made a curse to follow them and on the Day of Judgment they will be among the loathed and despised,Yi cia emi tua izhe nanao be emi boe Efo Alkiyamio ma agaa fe dan mini eza dede zhio aa gye yelea
We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations to give Insight to men and guidance and Mercy that they might receive admonition,Akika Yila litafi Ataura ya Musa baci na Yia alumma yan mafarizhi jin hallaka na Kpaata wuncinzhi eyan yekpazhi ayio be bawuI be yegunI ya zawangizhi ko be wuncinzhii aa -- sinsantu
 Thou wast not on the Western side when We decreed the Commission to Moses nor wast thou a witness of those events,Wyo madan kansanta eyi lozun yan pati Tuuri boa kamina Yijin wahayi ya Musa naa wyo madan mini zanazhi jin ri naboa
But We raised up new generations and long were the ages that passed over them but thou wast not a dweller among the people of Madyan rehearsing Our Signs to them but it is We Who send messengers with inspiration,Amaade Yi jin alitaa alummazhi dokun ekundo eya izhe cia lokpa fia wyo ma fedun dan tacin za Madyanazhio ci fe gba aya Yizhi ya aa amade Yide e tun wyo tun fia
 Nor wast thou at the side of the Mountain of Tur when we called to Moses Yet art thou sent as Mercy from thy Lord to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before thee in order that they may receive admonition,Wyo ma dan kansanta eba Tuuri bo kamina Yi yi Musa naa amaade ebo yeguno dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo eboma wyoojin jamaa nazhi laade gangba jincizhi shiboa na gangba ujin wo be wunciny agaade sinsantu
If We had not sent thee to the Quraish- in case a calamity should seize them for the deeds that their hands have sent forth they might say Our Lord! why didst Thou not sent us a messenger We should then have followed Thy Signs and been amongst those who believe!,Kagan umajin ebo masiiba ndoci be dea maa be iri etun nazhi egwaatsozhi la shidzo naa har ma atsoa fe be ganganKiila wyoci tun Tuci fi yi yia yino ngan daa yi ga emi tu aya wyozhi yi ma gaafe dan mini mumini zhio
But now when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves they say Why are not Signs sent to him like those which were sent to Moses Do they not then reject the Signs which were formerly sent to Moses They say Two kinds of sorcery each assisting the other! And they say For us we reject all such things!,Kamina gaskiya be be yaa dagan eba Yibo na aganKii la aci la iri yanna ala ya Musa na ya wyuna yino Asa shidzo batsozhio a yi yanna ala ya Musa na ganmanaa aci gan Ngan eyanmaci guba ayio Aci gan Akika yi yia jin kafirinci bea yin baenio
Say Then bring ye a Book from Allah which is a better guide than either of them that I may follow it! do if ye are truthful!,Gangan To ebe be Litafi ndoci dagan eba Soko nama la bawu be gana gubaaba na Alkuranu be Ataurae na ma mia la mitu na wunayi gaskiya tacizhi yeyio na
But if they hearken not to thee know that they only follow their own lusts and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts devoid of guidance from Allah for Allah guides not people given to wrong-doing,Kagan ma a zhe wyo gana to wyoo kpeo wo dano na kede etun yangbanazhi tsa e la mituo na Zii ma gbingan za nae la mitu etun yangbanu umayi be bawuI dagan eba Soko boa naa yino Azwalumizhi ke ekoa
But if they hearken not to thee know that they only follow their own lusts and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts devoid of guidance from Allah for Allah guides not people given to wrong-doing,Kagan ma a zhe wyo gana to wyoo kpeo wo dano na kede etun yangbanazhi tsa e la mituo na Zii ma gbingan za nae la mitu etun yangbanu umayi be bawuI dagan eba Soko boa naa yino Azwalumizhi ke ekoa
 Now have We caused the Word to reach them themselves in order that they may receive admonition,Akika Yi ma la egan zhi gun be dozhiI yaa ebo ko be wunciny agaa san tu
 Those to whom We sent the Book before this- they do believe in this revelation,Zanazhi ma yi la Litafi ndoci ya shidzo batsozhio na aa imani jin ganni beuyin
And when it is recited to them they say We believe therein for it is the Truth from our Lord indeed we have been Muslims bowing to Allah´s Will from before this,Ama ga gba kaatun yaa aajin agan gan Yia imani jin beu yin akika gaskiya uyio dagan eba Tsoci yi bo akika ma yiafe musulumizhi shidzo be dzo
 Twice will they be given their reward for that they have persevered that they avert Evil with Good and that they spend in charity out of what We have given them,Zawuncinzhi aa la egagbaazhi yaa zu-guba ebo hakuri naajin na amaajin afe da etun dede gwa ya be etun wangiI amaajin afe wu dukiya fi eko Soko dagan mini arziki nazhi Yi la yaa na
 And when they hear vain talk they turn away therefrom and say To us our deeds and to you yours peace be to you we seek not the ignorant,Amaga wo egan banza edzo banza aajin e la eti pan keu lugwa acia gangan Yi yi be egagba etun yi yin yetso mayi be egagba etun ye yin e fe lo yane egwa yi madan be jahilizhi yina
 It is true thou wilt not be able to guide every one whom thou lovest but Allah guides those whom He will and He knows best those who receive guidance,Akika wyo la zana ba wyo na ke eko woa amaade Soko gayi Etsu nae la zana gabaUna ke eko Wyun ga ma kpe zanazhi yi eza bawuzhi nao
 They say If we were to follow the guidance with thee we should be snatched away from our land Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds- a provision from Ourselves but most of them understand not,Aci gan Yiga mitu bawu nana be wyo yin aga yi fela dagan kin yan yibo Gan yaa gan Asa ujin yi ga la Harami shishi yaye be aminci nama e ku yangici sun-sunzhi iri ndondo bebo naa Ngan wuncin arziki uyio dagan eba Yibo Amaade ekundondoazhi ade kpikpea
And how many populations We destroyed which exulted in their life of ease and plenty! now those habitations of theirs after them are deserted- All but a miserable few! and We are their heirs!,Alummazhi ma danbo dokun nazhi yijin hallaka na aa edunfe izhea nyin-ya Emiazhi zhio na zando le gunbo zunmaaboa sai degi Yi ga mayi Egungicizhi yan bae nio
Nor was thy Lord the one to destroy a population until He had sent to its centre a messenger rehearsing to them Our Signs nor are We going to destroy a population except when its members practise iniquity,Tsoci wyo mae jin alkarya hallakaa sai Uga Tuci tun fi ezhi koazhio naafe gba aya Yizhi yaa na Yi mae jin alkarya ndondo hallaka sai de jamaa yanuzhi gaafe azwalumizhi
 The material things which ye are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter thereof but that which is with Allah is better and more enduring will ye not then be wise,Yandondo nama aga la yaye na to eyan eman-wo izhe uyi be ninpau yino Yanna madan eba Sokoo na de alheri gan wyun ga maa danubo Ki la ye cie jin hankalia yino
Are these two alike- one to whom We have made a goodly promise and who is going to reach its fulfilment and one to whom We have given the good things of this life but who on the Day of Judgment is to be among those brought up for punishment,Ngba zana Yi jinu alkawali wangi na nama wyuna be gun be yin na ugaazhe ye ni be zana ema izhe kawan yin Yi la yau cie wo-ona gancin ma Efo Alkiyamii aa kua ku dafi enao na
That Day Allah will call to them and say Where are my ´partners´- whom ye imagined to be such,Wyo mao pa Efo na Soko gaa yia na Ucia gangan Babo kuti nazhi yefe la pa Mi baci izheo na dano
 Those against whom the charge will be proved will say Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray we led them astray as we were astray ourselves we free ourselves from them in Thy presence it was not us they worshipped,Zanazhi ma azaba Sokoajin tabbata ta etiabo na gan Tsoci yi! Zananazhi gayi zanazhi yi gbin nao Yima gbinagbin kendoe yitso gbin na yimae wa egwa yi be eba wyoe akika ma ujin yi tsa afe wuna
It will be said to them Call upon your ´partners´ for help they will call upon them but they will not listen to them and they will see the Penalty before them how they will wish ´if only they had been open to guidance!´,Acigan E yi kuti yezhi be gancin aci yia ama zhea gana Acia azaba leye Aci fe jin guri gan e gan gan yeafe eza bawuzhia!
 That Day Allah will call to them and say What was the answer ye gave to the messengers,Wyo mao pa Efo na agaa yia na Ucia gan gan Ki yi ezhe na yela ya Tucizhi nao
Then the whole story that Day will seem obscure to them like light to the blind and they will not be able even to question each other,Labari kpaata cia gbina eyeo fo wuncin atso ma gbin dozhi gan woa
 But any that in this life had repented believed and worked righteousness will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation,To amaade za na ga tuba jin ucia imani jin uci lotun wangi na to kengi uyio na ugaafe dan mini eza robo zhio na
 Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases no choice have they in the matter Glory to Allah! and far is He above the partners they ascribe to Him!,Tsoci wyo maa jin ujin alitta yanna ga baUna Umae tsa yanna ga baUna ujin aa tsa wun etsaa Soko maa li Umaa la tu ke yannazhi e la pau baci na lugwa
And thy Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal,Soko ma kpe yannazhi swo fi yangbanazhio kpata nao to yannazhi e latu na
And He is Allah There is no god but He To Him be praise at the first and at the last for Him is the Command and to Him shall ye all be brought back,Wyunga mayi Soko ade Tsoci ndoci naajin bauta ta naa sai Wyuny yebo kpaataajin tabbata yaU dan izheo to Alkiyamio hukunci kpata ma Wyun ga wuno ebaU gabo aa kue zheban lo
Say See ye If Allah were to make the night perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment what god is there other than Allah who can give you enlightenment Will ye not then hearkenGangan ,Ngba ye le yea Soko ga yeshi laa fedun ya ye tutun yin har da Efo Alkiyami Zii danbo nayi Tsoci wuncin zunma Sokoo nao naala haske be yaye nao Kashi ye e wo gan woa
Say See ye If Allah were to make the day perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment what god is there other than Allah who can give you a night in which ye can rest Will ye not then see,Gangan Kashi ye le yea Soko ga igidi batin laa fedun yaye tutunyin har da Efo Alkiyami zi yi Tsoci wuncin zunma Soko naa la yeshi be yaye na yea fe de yangban tacin dan nao Kashi ye e kpaye kpaa
It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day- that ye may rest therein and that ye may seek of his Grace- and in order that ye may be grateful,Udan mini yegunUbo na wyuna yeshi to batin jin yaye ebo ye shi yangban tae danbo yeshii ye mae wa arzikieza bo yigidii na ujin wo be wunciny ye gaafe zanazhie jin yebo na
 The Day that He will call on them He will say Where are my ´partners´ whom ye imagined to be such,To efo na ugaa yia na Ucia gangan Babo kuti nazhi yefe la pa Mi baci izheo na dano
And from each people shall We draw a witness and We shall say Produce your Proof then shall they know that the Truth is in Allah alone and the lies which they invented will leave them in lurch,Yiciga eri ndoci wa-ka dagan mini alumma ndondo agayi Annabiazhio Yicia gangan Ela hujja yezhi be na la yeci layan pa Mi baci na atso ci gaa kpe kede gaskiya be Soko-yin-udano na yannazhii ma afe tswa kpaata na ci gaa gbina yeo
 Qarun was doubtless of the people of Moses but he acted insolently towards them such were the treasures We had bestowed on him that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men behold his people said to him Exult not for Allah loveth not those who exult in riches,Akika Karuna udan mini jamaa yan Musa zhio ucia gbin tu be ayin Yi ma twaurya be edzunba yan arzikizhii na ma giyekoazhi kara bididiayio ya jamaa nazhi yi kagbocizhi na Kamina jamaa yanuzhi gan yau gan Ga fe jin alfahri ma akika Sokoe wa zanazhi gae jin alfahri naa
But seek with the wealth which Allah has bestowed on thee the Home of the Hereafter nor forget thy portion in this world but do thou good as Allah has been good to thee and seek not occasions for mischief in the land for Allah loves not those who do mischief,Wyo mao wa emi yan Zoba wangi dan mini yannazhi Soko ga la twarya ya wyo na wyo mao ga ba robo wyozhi tan dan mini izheo ma wyo mao feo jin bolobolo kendoe Soko jin bolobolo ya wyo na Wyo ma ga wa eyan-nyin dan kinbo ma akika Sokoe wa zanazhie nyin-yan naa
He said This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him whole generations- which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount of riches they had collected but the wicked are not called immediately to account for their sinsUgan ,Akika ala dukiya la yami eti kpikpe na mide nao Beke u kpe gan Sokoa alumma nazhi dokun na nazhi shidzo amade kagbo amade dukiya ganu na wyuna jin hallakaa naa Amaade Sokoe da da gbin lefi jincizhi gan eti etun lefiazhi boa
 So he went forth among his people in the pride of his wordly glitter Said those whose aim is the Life of this World Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!,Ucia tinya fi jamaa yanuzhi dan mini ninpaubo zanazhie wa izhe na cigan Kaasa! E gangan yitso de iri yanna a laya karuna daa naa Akika wyuna de dukiya sarauyin
 But those who had been granted true knowledge said Alas for you! The reward of Allah in the Hereafter is best for those who believe and work righteousness but this none shall attain save those who steadfastly persevere in good,Zanazhi ma ala kpikpe ya na gan Alaa wa be yin ngan laada egagba yan Soko ude alheri gan ya zana ga imani jin uci lotun wangi na Amade zanaajin kpade yin be uyin naa sai de eza hakurizhi
Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house and he had not the least little party to help him against Allah nor could he defend himself,Yiciu zhekpe fi kinbo be emiko nautu na umade jamaa ndocizhi nazhia jinu taimako zunma Sokoo naa uma dan mini zana zhia de nasara na boa
 And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow Ah! it is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it to any of His servants He pleases! had it not been that Allah was gracious to us He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject Allah will assuredly never prosper,Gancin zanazhi fe jin kauna kinigibau tsuwo na cia tin ba aci fe gan gan Eyan mamaki asa de Soko deajin ula arziki la ya zana gabaU mini wuzhiUzhiona Umae yiuku be kagan ujin ebo saa yan Soko boa daa aga yitso zhekpe Oo akika kafirizhi aa tso guria
 That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high-handedness or mischief on earth and the end is best for the righteous,Emi wangi yan Zoba wuncin yie lau laya zanazhie wotiasan dan kinboa na amae nyin yana na Zo ba wangi ma ugaajin tabbata ya zanazhi gae sundan Soko na
 If any does good the reward to him is better than his deed but if any does evil the doers of evil are only punished to the extent of their deeds,Zaeni ndondo naga be be etun wangi ninii na wyunade egagba na gan acin na zana ma ga be be etun dede e na to aa la egagba ndoci ya zanazhie lotun dede naa sai de yan iri etun dede na aga lo na
Verily He Who ordained the Qur´an for thee will bring thee back to the Place of Return Say My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance and who is in manifest error,Akika Etsu wuncin nacin Alkuranu ya wyo na uga wyo la da ezhekeba Gan yaa gan Tsoci mi tsa kpe gano yan zana be be bawui na to zana ma dan mini egbin gbangbao nao
 And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject Allah´s Message,Wyo ma fe zana fe kpaye le gan aa cin Litafi be ya wyo naa sai de yegun na febe dagan eba Tsoci wyobo na Wyo mao gafe taimako jinci ya kafirizhi ma

 Do men think that they will be left alone on saying We believe and that they will not be tested,Kashi! Zawangizhi e kpa ye kpa gan a laafo be fitinan ndondoe ebo emi naakpe ci gan a yaa imani jin nan
 We did test those before them and Allah will certainly know those who are true from those who are false,Akika yi la mimacinlezhi be ya aluma na zhi shi a dzo na akika Soko ga za gaskiyazhi tu la za ndondo a kpea ye akika Soko ga ganmanan zun-cizhi tula za ndondo a kpe a ye

For those whose hopes are in the meeting with Allah in the Hereafter let them strive for the term appointed by Allah is surely coming and He hears and knows all things,Zaeni ndondo na gae kpa gun gun wangi be Sokoe na  u la u din yin be etun guruzhi akika eka na Soko bayan gungun wuncin nan wune be Akika Soko e wo Uma yi be kpikpe yan dondoe

Those who believe and work righteous deeds- from them shall We blot out all evil that may be in them and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds,Za na zhi ma ga imani jin na a cieke zhe lotun wangi wangizhi na Yi Soko ga etun dede azhi kpata fin ya yi maagaagba be bolobolo na tso gan etun nan zhi a felo izheo nan
 We have enjoined on man kindness to parents but if they either of them strive to force thee to join with Me in worship anything of which thou hast no knowledge obey them not Ye have all to return to me and I will tell you the truth of all that ye did,Yi ma jin zawangi wasiyancibe jinjin yan bolo boloe lo eba yanmanciuzhi gubaba amma a ga jin wyo foro gan wyo lo etun ndoci na yi yan shiriku na eza la apa Soko baci gaka rao jin biyayya yaama eba Mi ga yea kezhe zhin baeni bo Mi cia ya ye labari etun nazhi ye fe lo kpaata na

 Then there are among men such as say We believe in Allah but when they suffer affliction in the cause of Allah they treat men´s oppression as if it were the Wrath of Allah! And if help comes to thee from thy Lord they are sure to say We have always been with you! Does not Allah know best all that is in the hearts of all creation,A ma de dan mini zawangizhio na zhi e kpe mi gangan Yi a imani jin be Sokoe na kanga gancin a ga beu jin gun ta eti etun Soko na wune lo na wuna fitina zawangizhi la ke azaba Soko na akika ma taimako Soko ga da be munafuki nnazhi a fe gan gan akika be ye yin ga yi dano eti taimako adini bo a sa U jin Soko ga de kpikpe gan yan yan-nanzhi fi ekogi alitazhio kpata naa
Then there are among men such as say We believe in Allah but when they suffer affliction in the cause of Allah they treat men´s oppression as if it were the Wrath of Allah!

 And Allah most certainly knows those who believe and as certainly those who are Hypocrites,Akika Soko yi be kpikpe za na zhi yi be imanii na U ma gaatu la akika U yi be kpikpe yan Munafuki zhi za nazhi e ye Musulumizhi emi kpereo yangbanazhi ma gboka be imani yina na U ma gatu la
And the Unbelievers say to those who believe Follow our path and we will bear the consequences of your faults Never in the least will they bear their faults in fact they are liars!,Akika kafirizhi za na zhi a cinmana bo be Sokoe na a jin a fe gan be za na zhi a imani jin be gaskiyae na gan e da be ye la mi etu ekpa yi eko izhe le yan kafirincia akika ma leifi ndondo na ye ga jin na yia -- karau la ya ye alkiyamio akika ganmanan tsa e zuno a la kara ndondo yaa wo efo wuncina
 They will bear their own burdens and other burdens along with their own and on the Day of Judgments they will be called to account for their falsehoods,Akika a tso ga karazhi la a ma kezhe la kara yan za na zhi a ku fi eko lemba Soko-ona a be yan a tso zhi be a tso nanzhi ma la mi tua na a yi be karaatsozhi akika ma Soko a gbin a gan efo alkiyami yan ekpa ganmanan nazhi a fe tswa cie la gbin zazhi izheo na
We once sent Noah to his people and he tarried among them a thousand years less fifty but the Deluge overwhelmed them while they persisted in sin,Akika Yi a Annabi Nuhu tun fi za kin miuzhi U ma fedun ta cinabo fe wu yan Soko ya har eya kpawtsun cia din eya arata a ma -- gan Sokoa Soko cia jin hallaka be edu yan TUFANUI akika ma a tso ga jin eti tacina zwaluncio

And We also saved Abraham behold he said to his people Serve Allah and fear Him that will be best for you- If ye understand!,To Ibrahim e pa ka minan u fe gan ya jamaa yanUzhi gan e jin bawta ya Soko ye mae fe sundanU be gaskiyae wuncin na yea jin na U de alheri gan ya ye ye ga de kpikpe de na
 For ye do worship idols besides Allah and ye invent falsehood The things that ye worship besides Allah have no power to give you sustenance then seek ye sustenance from Allah serve Him and be grateful to Him to Him will be your return,Akika yan na zhi ye jin bawta ya ke Soko lugwa na kutizhi a yio ganmana ma u yio nanzhi ye tswa elo be zhin ina Akika za nanzhi ye jin bawta ya ke Soko lugwa na akika yan mulki yan arziki yezhi u fi egwaazhi boa Eboa acino zaeni ndondo u feu wa arziki eba Soko gbuugi Ye mae dokun be ibada jin eya Soko Ye mae fe jin yebo eyau sarauyin Akika ma ebau ga yia kezhe lo kpaatao

 See they not how Allah originates creation then repeats it truly that is easy for Allah,Kashi a la hankali la tu etun Sokoa Kendoe wune ca jinjin halitta ca naa U cia kezhe u ye lazhin rfo alkiyamii Akika jinjin wuncin eyan finfanci u yi eba Soko bo
 Say Travel through the earth and see how Allah did originate creation so will Allah produce a later creation for Allah has power over all things,Gan ya gan a da zana kpe eti kin boto epeu to ekpau ye mae cin ele lo kendoe Soko ca jinjin halittazhi ca kakayin na Soko maakezhe a yejin Jinjin yan ezo ba efo alkiyamii Akika Soko de iko be kagboe eti yan ndondo
He punishes whom He pleases and He grants Mercy to whom He pleases and towards Him are ye turned,Wune jin za nan ga bau na azaba eti adalincio U mae la yegun U wuna twarya yaza na ga bau na kpatay ma Soko ga yia zheban da tsuno
Not on earth nor in heaven will ye be able fleeing to frustrate his Plan nor have ye besides Allah any protector or helper,Akika ma Ye gan Soko gwa kpe eti kin boa Ye ma zanu zan kpea Ka ma wunayi sanma bo ye fio Ye ma deza ndondo a la alamari yezhi kpetso a gan Sokoa Ye ma de Taimako jinci yan hakika a gan Sokoa
Those who reject the Signs of Allah and the Meeting with Him in the Hereafter- it is they who shall despair of My Mercy it is they who will suffer a most grievous Penalty,Za nanzhi man a jin kafirinci be aya Soko Zhii na a ci la mi tu ba wu yan Alkuranu edunfe izhea boa na a ma jin imani yan gaskiya be efo yan gungun be Soko yina na akika za nnazhi a kauna ba be rahama Sokoe Za wuncin zhi maa gun be azaba na tan sarawyin na
 So naught was the answer of Abraham´s people except that they said Slay him or burn him But Allah did save him from the Fire Verily in this are Signs for people who believe,Ezhe nan jama yan Annabi Ibrahima zhi ya na baci na ujina wazi zo na u ga yi yeu wu ko ma yeudin nan Soko ci u wa dzun ena o akika wunci-n wu gwa yan zankpe Soko ya za nanzhi ga yi be imani ina
And he said For you ye have taken for worship idols besides Allah out of mutual love and regard between yourselves in this life but on the Day of Judgment ye shall disown each other and curse each other and your abode will be the Fire and ye shall have none to help,Annabi Ibrahima ci kezhe gan ya gan Akika ye ga egwa la sun kutizhi ci e jin bawta ya ke Soko lugwa kawanyinebo emawo yan gungunyekan yetso be do zhii nan ye wo dan edun fe izheo na Akika efo alkiyami ga da be yetso be dozhi ga dozhi sunzunye ye maa fe bu kuti kpe dozhi ezhe ke baema u yi enan za ndondo maajine taimako fo wuncina
But Lut had faith in Him He said I will leave home for the sake of my Lord for He is Exalted in Might and Wise,Lutu cia imani jin be Annabi Ibrahimae Annabi Ibrahima ci gan akika mi ga kpe zhiabo da ezhi nan Tsoci mi ga tsa ya mi na wuna kpe dagan kin yan IRAAKIO u ci da kin yan SHAM be FALASTINUI Akika Soko u ga yi Etsu zankpeo Egba u man yio dan jinjin yandondobo
And We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation and We granted him his reward in this life and he was in the Hereafter of the company of the Righteous,Yi ci twaurya be Ishaqae to yegiu Yaakubae Yi cia zuriya u zhi tsa be Annabcii be litafi nan zhi afe cin be yaa nan Yi ma egagba la a yau izheo akika ma alkiyamio u dan mini wuzhi guru zhio
And remember Lut behold he said to his people ,Ye do commit lewdness such as no people in Creation ever committed before youTo Annabi Lutu epa ka mi na U fe gan ya jamaa yanuzhi gan akika ye lo tun swakwa alfahsha nan alita ndondo laa shi ye dzo be luilou yina nan
 Do ye indeed approach men and cut off the highway- and practise wickedness even in your councils But his people gave no answer but this they said Bring us the Wrath of Allah if thou tellest the truth,Ye da keba be bagi nan yinci yezhii Ye ma e da gara kpe ekotio Ye mae lo tun alfahsha nan nan dan gungun yekan bazhi ye zhio Ye sun zun yea Ezhe nan a la ya Annabi Lutu nan u fea sai-dai da la azaba Soko be ya yi wuna yi mini za gaskiyazhi bo wo dano nan
 He said O my Lord! help Thou me against people who do mischief!,Annabi Lutu Ci gan Tsoci ya mi nasara ta eti jamaa nanzhi e nyin yan zhi daa nan
He said O my Lord! help Thou me against people who do mischief!,Annabi Lutu Ci gan Tsoci ya mi nasara ta eti jamaa nanzhi e nyin yan zhi daa nan
When Our Messengers came to Abraham with the good news they said We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township for truly they are addicted to crime,Ka mi nan Malaika Yi zhi la labari yangbanfa yan egi man be ya Ibrahima nan a gan gan Akika Yiga jamaa yan Alkarya nnazhii jin hallaka ebo na azwalumizhi ayio
 He said But there is Lut there They said Well do we know who is there  we will certainly save him and his following- except his wife she is of those who lag behind!,Annabi Ibrahima ci jin lali gan Akika Lutu dan mini kin wuncino A ci gan yau gan yi kpe za nanzhi fi bo nan gan zandondo Akika yi gau wadzun gan-ni be jamaa yanuzhi sai-dai yinzagiu yinmiu wuna fe dan tacin za nanzhi a fi azaba o nan
 And when Our Messengers came to Lut he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless to protect them but they said Fear thou not nor grieve we are here to save thee and thy following except thy wife she is of those who lag behind,Ka mi nan Tuci Yi zhi malaikazhi lo eba Lutu nan yangbanu wuna nyin hankaliu maa sansan a ci gan ga sundan ma wo mao ga nyin yangban man akika yi ga woe wa dzun to jamaa yanozhi sai dai yinzagi woe wuna fe dan tacin za nanzhi a fi azaba o nan
For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a Punishment from heaven because they have been wickedly rebellious,Akika Yi a cin azaba be dagan sanmao kpe jamaa yan alkarya nan nanzhi ebo etun fasikanci nan zhi e lo nan
 And We have left thereof an evident Sign for any people who care to understand,Akika Yia aya wanciko lugwa cici mini yan nan ajin be za nan nan zhii nan ebo u la u fe gangba u ya za nanzhi ga yi be ankalii nan
To the Madyan people We sent their brother Shu´aib Then he said O my people! serve Allah and fear the Last Day nor commit evil on the earth with intent to do mischief,Jamaa yan Madyanazhi ma Yi tun yegia Annabi Shuaibu fia u ci gan Ye jamaa yan mizhi e jin bawta ya Soko Ye mae fe jin kawna yan yegun U efo alkiyamii Ye mae ga fe nyin yanzhi kpe eti kin bo man
But they rejected him Then the mighty Blast seized them and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,A cia egan U yi ganmanan Soko cia wan be kabara tsawa tsuntsun-nui a cia tin ba fi emiazhio a jin hallaka kpe vokpaazhio
Remember also the ´Ad and the Thamud people clearly will appear to you from the traces of their buildings their fate the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them and kept them back from the Path though they were gifted with intelligence and skill,To jamaa yan Aduzhi to Samuduzhi kpata Yiajin hallaka -- gananin alama yan azabazhi maatula dan mini edunfe bazhio ya ye shaitan cia etun sakpazhi la apanin fia u cia pan ke eko Soko lugwa a tso ma yi be hankali
Remember also the ´Ad and the Thamud people clearly will appear to you from the traces of their buildings their fate the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them and kept them back from the Path though they were gifted with intelligence and skill,To jamaa yan Aduzhi to Samuduzhi kpata Yiajin hallaka -- gananin alama yan azabazhi maatula dan mini edunfe bazhio ya ye shaitan cia etun sakpazhi la apanin fia u cia pan ke eko Soko lugwa a tso ma yi be hankali
Remember also Qarun Pharaoh and Haman there came to them Moses with Clear Signs but they behaved with insolence on the earth yet they could not overreach Us,To Qaruna nan yi be ewo tsaba nande lisafia nan to Firawna nan fe ti binakun dan mulki u bonan to Hamana nan yi waziri Firawna eti binakun tio nan kpaata Yi a jin hallaka -- gananin akika Annabi Musa la bayanizhi be ya a cia gbo tika kpeti kin bo akika a gan Soko gwa woa
 Each one of them We seized for his crime of them against some We sent a violent tornado with showers of stones some were caught by a mighty Blast some We caused the earth to swallow up and some We drowned in the waters It was not Allah Who injured or oppressed them They injured and oppressed their own souls,Ebo a cino Yi a zaeni ndondoa wan be leifi u yin mini a bo a de nan zhi kabara ga jina hallakao nan mini a bo ade nanzhi Yi a kpe fi kin bo nan a ma de miniabo nanzhi Yi gbina fi nuwano nan Akika U yin nan a gan gan Soko a jingun naa ammaade a tso zawangizhi tsae jin eti taacina guno

 Verily Allah doth know of every thing whatever that they call upon besides Him and He is Exalted in power Wise,Akika Soko Uyi be kpikpe yandondo nan zawangizhi e yi ye a cie wun ke Soko lugwa nan Wyun Soko ma Etsu zankpe U yio Egba U ma yio dan jinjin yandondo
And such are the Parables We set forth for mankind but only those understand them who have knowledge,Egan la san tatu wuncinzhi kpata Yi e jiu-yeji ya zawangizhi zaeni ndondo ma ga la ankali tua sai zanazhi yi eza kpikpezhi nan
 Allah created the heavens and the earth in true proportions verily in that is a Sign for those who believe,Soko a alitta yan sanmazhi to kin jin be tsunwan gaskiyae akika mini wuncino sinsantu yan zankpe Soko dan-bo ya za nanzhi yi Muminizhi nan
Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee and establish regular Prayer for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds and remembrance of Allah is the greatest thing in life without doubt And Allah knows the deeds that ye do,Ya wye Annabi Fegba yannazhi a jin wahayiazhi be ya wye fi mini litafio nan wo maola sallaho kuo gikini akika sallah wune kan gwa etun zunyesunzhi to etun swakwazhi akikama pipa yan Soko wuna gbota gan yandondo mini bautao Soko ma U yi be kpikpe yannazhi ye jin nan
 And dispute ye not with the People of the Book except with means better than mere disputation unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong and injury but say We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you Our Allah and your Allah is one and it is to Him we bow in Islam,Ye mae ga fe gbomi be za ba litafizhi ma sai de be eza nan gye gan nan sai dai nanzhi gafe binakun ticizhi nan acie yiba ba ye nan ye mae gan gan Yia imani jin be yan nan acin be ya yi nan uga yi ALKURANUO be yan nan acin be ya ye nan litafi atawra to linjila Tsoci yi ma to Tsoci ye niniu yio yi ma kpatsun ta ya foro Soko
And thus it is that We have sent down the Book to thee So the People of the Book believe therein as also do some of these pagan Arabs and none but Unbelievers reject our signs,Acin ga ga u yio Yi cin litafi be ya wyoe za nanzhi yi la litafi ya nan e ya gaskiya be u yin to mini za nnanzhio jamaa yan alumma nnanzhi a de na gaskiya ya beu yin nan a de za naa gbomi be aya yi zhii naa Sai de kafirizhi
And thou wast not able to recite a Book before this Book came nor art thou able to transcribe it with thy right hand In that case indeed would the talkers of vanities have doubted,Wyo ma fe za na e gba litafi ndondo shidzo kafi Alkuranu naa wo ma fe za na e ka yan be gwalowyo yin naa ka cana eza dedezhi a fe jin kelokezhin eti Alkuranuo
Nay here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge and none but the unjust reject Our Signs,Alkuranu Ujin eyan kelokezhina Alkuranu ayazhi a yio nanzhia tula dan mini yangban za nanzhi Soko la kpikpe ya nan Zae ni ndondo mae gbomi be aya Yizhi yina sai dai azwalumizhi
Ye they say Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord Say The signs are indeed with Allah and I am indeed a clear Warner,A kafirizhi ci gan Kiila a ci cin ayazhi nanzhi e wu gwa zankpezhi nan be yau dagan nko yan Tsociu boa yino Gan ya gan Aya yan egwa wu wuncinzhi eba Soko boa dano Mii man mi fea sai dai gangba jin ci nan tso a tula nan
 And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them Verily in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe,Asha U kunke yaa nan Mi a litafi cin be a ya wyoe acie gbau yaa kando-kando e naa Ngan mini wuncino yegunko danbo be sinsantui ya za nanzhi a imani jin nan
Say Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you He knows what is in the heavens and on earth And it is those who believe in vanities and reject Allah that will perish in the end,Annabi Gan ya gan Soko a kunke yan Eri jin-ci eti yan nanzhi dan tsakani mibo be eyin nan Soko yi be kpikpe yan yan nanzhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo nan za nanzhiima a imani jin be ganmanae nan acia jin kafirci a cin mannanbo be Sokoe nan za wuncinzhi ga yi eza hasarazhio
 They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment for them had it not been for a term of respite appointed the Punishment would certainly have come to them and it will certainly reach them- of a sudden while they perceive not!,A maa jin a fe din wyo ye be bibe yan azabae kau jin ebo eka nan Soko a yanu ba cici a ni naa da azaba ada be tsuna akika ma azaba a be be ya a be girkui lokaci nan a tu sanwo wuna nan
They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment but of a surety Hell will encompass the Rejecters of Faith!-,Edin wyo ye be bibe yan azabae akika ma ena yan jahannama uga ma kafirizhi kezhe
 On the Day that the Punishment shall cover them from above them and from below them and a Voice shall say Taste ye the fruits of your deeds!,Efo wuncin azaba ga rukpea dagan titabo da bici takoazhi Malaikazhi cia gan ya gan efe fin azaba yan etun dede nanzhi ye fe lo izheo nan
O My servants who believe! truly spacious is My Earth therefore serve ye Me - and Me alone!,Ya ye wuzhi mi zhi nan zhi a imani jin nan akika kin yan Mi nan Mi ta cici ya ye nan u -- pe saraw yin ebo acino efe jin bauta ya Mi
Every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to Us shall ye be brought back,Rayi ndondo uga egwa la a dan tsutsuo daa mi gancin ma eba Mi Soko ga a kezhe kuye zhino
 But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness - to them shall We give a Home in Heaven- lofty mansions beneath which flow rivers- to dwell therein for aye- an excellent reward for those who do good!-,Za nan zhi ga imani jin a cie lo tun wangizhi nan Yia ya ecin ba edunfe ba mini aljannao kata kozhi nanzhi eduzhi e je fi tako a bo nan ba ga bo afi tutunyino madanla be egagba yan za nanzhi e lo tun wangizhi nan
 Those who persevere in patience and put their trust in their Lord and Cherisher,Za nanzhi a hakuri jin nan a maa fe za nanzhi a alamariazhi kpata a yakpe Tsocia nan
How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance It is Allah who feeds both them and you for He hears and knows all things,Dokun dokun yan dabbazhi ujin atso e la kara gigiazhia Soko ga yi Etsu nane yaa gi nano to ye tso zawangizhi Soko gae kpa yeo Soko Etsu u yio nae wo esansan yandondo nan U ma yi be kpikpe yandondoe
If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon to his Law they will certainly reply Allah How are they then deluded away from the truth,Wyo ma ga gbina gan gan Zii jin sanmazhio to kin yino zii ma jin foro yan igidi to etswao A gan gan Soko Kici be la acie la ankali yezhi pan ya ke wunwun yan Soko lugwao
Allah enlarges the sustenance which He gives to whichever of His servants He pleases and He similarly grants by strict measure as He pleases for Allah has full knowledge of all things,Soko gae la arziki a ya zae ga bau nan mini wuzhiuuzhi bo u mae kezhe la arziki a yiku ya zana a ba u nan akika Soko de kpikpe yan hali ndondo nan -- zandondo yin nan
And if indeed thou ask them who it is that sends down rain from the sky and gives life therewith to the earth after its death they will certainly reply Allah! Say Praise be to Allah! But most of them understand not,Akika wyo ga gbina gan gan Zi yiza nae du ele zhin dagan sanmao nano U ci kezhea kin dan rayi baci nan u yi eyan tsutsuci nano Akika a gan gan  Sokoo Gan gan yebo kpaata jin tabbata ya Soko Asha ekun dondoazhi a de hankalia
 What is the life of this world but amusement and play but verily the Home in the Hereafter- that is life indeed if they but knew,Edunfe izhe nanan u yi yandoa sai de eyan shagala be edzoe akika eku batsozhi u ga yi edunfeba yan eman rayi wangio da aci gan a de kpikpe de nan
Now if they embark on a boat they call on Allah making their devotion sincerely and exclusively to Him but when He has delivered them safely to dry land behold they give a share of their worship to others!-,Abeke zawangizhi ga gandan mini eya nuwano nan a fe ti lali kpe Soko a adua be bautae tadzu ya ninimbo yan Soko be jinjin adini ka minan U gaa wadzun a cia pa tu lafiya nan a a fe za nanazhi e la yan a pa Soko baci nan
Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts and giving themselves up to worldly enjoyment! But soon will they know,Ebo mana cin bo abo be alhairi nanzhi Soko la yaa nan ebo ma a de ba a woma kendoe u sa fi yangbanazhi nan bele yin atsoa be de kpikpe ke u -- yin eza ucin manan ubo be Soko yina nan
 Do they not then see that We have made a sanctuary secure and that men are being snatched away from all around them Then do they believe in that which is vain and reject the Grace of Allah,Kashi a leba ye lea kendoe Yi yia Harami Maka laa fe ezhi yan aminci naa Ezhi nanzhi ma maa -- ba nan zawangizhi e wu dozhi wu fi bo naa Kashi ganmanan ga ye ajin imani be yino ye cie cin manan bo be eyan emanzhi nan Soko la a ya ye nan
And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects the Truth when it reaches him Is there not a home in Hell for those who reject Faith,Zii ma gafe binakun tici gan za nane tswa ganmanna ta Soko nano ko ma wuna gaskiya yi ganmannan lokaci nan gaskiya be yau nano Asha ecin ba yan azaba udan jahannamao ya kafirizhia
 And those who strive in Our cause- We will certainly guide them to our Paths For verily Allah is with those who do right,Za nanzhii ma a ga jin kokari eti wiwa yan yarda Mi Soko nan akika Mi ga la ake eko Mi zhi akika taimako Soko u dan be za nanzhi e jin bolobolo dan edunfe izheabo nan

 Allah! There is no god but He-the Living the Self-Subsisting Eternal,Soko! Ade yandoci naajin bawta ya be gaskiyae na sai de Wyuny Etsu rayi Etsu naakunke be yandondoe na
It is He Who sent down to thee step by step in truth the Book confirming what went before it and He sent down the Law of Moses and the Gospel of Jesus before this as a guide to mankind and He sent down the criterion of judgment between right and wrong,Wyuna Litafi cin bea ya wyoe ganni be gaskiyae umae la gaskiya-bo yan litafi nazhi shiu dzo na wu Uma cin Attaura be to Injeela
Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty and Allah is Exalted in Might Lord of Retribution,Shidzo batsozhio bawu a yio ya zawangizhi u ma cin Funruqanu Litafi na la erikpe dan tsakani gaskiya be ganmanae na Akika zanazhia jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhiy na azaba na gbota na gaajin tabbata yaa Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu na yi be azaba na tsanni uyio
From Allah verily nothing is hidden on earth or in the heavens,Shidzo bats`ozhio bawu a yio ya zawangizhi u ma cin Furuqanu Litafi na la erikpe dan tsakani gaskiya be ganmanae na Akika zanazhia jin kafirnci be `aya Soko zhiy na azaba na gbota na gaajin tabbata yaa Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu na yi be azaba na tsanni na uyio
He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases There is no god but He the Exalted in Might the Wise,Wyun ga yi Etsu nae tswa ye dan mini ewanzhio kendoe ga ba U nao Ade yandoci naawun be gaskiyae naa saide Wyuny na yi Etsu zankpe uma yi Etsu hikima na
 He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book In it are verses basic or fundamental of established meaning they are the foundation of the Book others are allegorical But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical seeking discord and searching for its hidden meanings but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say We believe in the Book the whole of it is from our Lord and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding,Wyun ga cin litafi be ya wyo yo miniu bo ayazhi danbo nazhi bayani hukunciazhi yi bibaci na a ga dokun gan fi litafi bo ndocizhi madanbo bayani hukuncizhi be dozhi Ammaa za nazhi yangbaazhi a pan ke gaskiya lugwa na elami-la-tu nazhi ga bedozhi miniubo na ebo wiwa yan fitinao be wiwa fasara eti etun yangbao zandondo ma kpe fasarau yan gaskiya yea saide Soko Za nazhi maa shidu dan ilimio na ajin afe gan Yi yia imani jin be uyin kpatau daga eba Tsuci yi bo ufe beo Amade za nazhie kpaye naa saide eza ankalizhi
 Our Lord! they say Let not our hearts deviate now after Thou hast guided us but grant us mercy from Thine own Presence for Thou art the Grantor of bounties without measure,Tsoci yi! Ga pan yangban yi ke gaskiiya lugwa ma baci na Wyoa yi wu bani na ma Wyo mao twarya yeguno yayi dagan nko wyo bo akika wyoe Etsu ryatwa wyo yio
Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day about which there is no doubt for Allah never fails in His promise,Ya wyo Tsuci yi! Akika wyo ga yi za naaku zawangizhi yekan dan mini efo na kelo kezhin ndondo dan boa nao AkikaSokoe le lokaci alkawali baa
Those who reject Faith- neither their possessions nor their numerous progeny will avail them aught against Allah They are themselves but fuel for the Fire,Akika za na zhia jin kafirinci na dukiyaazhi to egiazhi a kunke yaa wo be yandondoe eba Soko boa a wuncinzhima agayi emi be cigbantun yan ena zhio
Their plight will be no better than that of the people of Pharaoh and their predecessors They denied our Signs and Allah called them to account for their sins For Allah is strict in punishment,Tabiazhi yi ke yan za ba Firauna zhi na to za nazhi shia dzo na a aya yizhi yi ganmana Soko ma cia wan be zunubiazhi Soko ma Etsu uyio na gbata azabao na
Say to those who reject Faith Soon will ye be vanquished and gathered together to Hell-an evil bed indeed to lie on!,Gan ya za nazhia jin kafirinci na gan Bele-yin agae zankpe ama gae ku yekan da jahannama be bibi maajin tabbata ya yantaci wuncin
There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met in combat One was fighting in the cause of Allah the other resisting Allah these saw with their own eyes Twice their number But Allah doth support with His aid whom He pleaseth In this is a warning for such as have eyes to see,Akika aya wanciko wunafe yaye dan mini jamaa guba nazhi gun be dozhi ekundao na jamaa kasan nini egunkun ta eti eko Soko kasan baci ma yan Kafirizhiu yio aci e leye ganajin Musulumizhi guba lile ye yan Soko mae la kagbo a ya za na ga Una be mae la kagbo a ya za na ga ba Una be Nasara UyinAkika mini wuncino eyan yekpa danbo ya zanazhi gayi eza baseera zhi na
Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet Women and sons Heaped-up hoards of gold and silver horses branded for blood and excellence and wealth of cattle and well-tilled land Such are the possessions of this world´s life but in nearness to Allah is the best of the goals To return to,A wiwa yan eyan shahawazhi pa nini fi zawangizhi yan yinzagizhi egizhi to dukiya nazhi yi epa epazhi yan zinariya be azarfae na to doko nazhia pa nin na to dabbazhi to yangici sunsunzhi Wuncinzhi kpata eyan emawo izhe ayio Soko ma ebaugabo ezhe keba wangi dano
 Say Shall I give you glad tidings of things Far better than those For the righteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord with rivers flowing beneath therein is their eternal home with companions pure and holy and the good pleasure of Allah For in Allah´s sight are all His servants,Gan gan kashi min yaye labari yan natsozhi de alheri gan wuncinzhina Ya zanazhi ga sundan Soko na Aljanna nazhi nuwan zhieje fi takoabo na danbo yaa eba yan Tsociabo bagabo maafi tutunyino To yinmizhi nazhi yi lilicizhina ganni be yeda jin dagan eba Soko Soko mae le wuzhizhi ye be iri yan nazhi ejin na
 Say Shall I give you glad tidings of things Far better than those For the righteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord with rivers flowing beneath therein is their eternal home with companions pure and holy and the good pleasure of Allah For in Allah´s sight are all His servants,Gan gan kashi min yaye labari yan natsozhi de alheri gan wuncinzhina Ya zanazhi ga sundan Soko na Aljanna nazhi nuwan zhieje fi takoabo na danbo yaa eba yan Tsociabo bagabo maafi tutunyino To yinmizhi nazhi yi lilicizhina ganni be yeda jin dagan eba Soko Soko mae le wuzhizhi ye be iri yan nazhi ejin na
Those who show patience Firmness and self-control who are true in word and deed who worship devoutly who spend in the way of Allah and who pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning,Zanazhi jin hakuri na to za nazhiyi za gaskiya zhi na to za nazhie dakpya na To za nazhie wu dukiya fi eko wangio na to za nazhie ba gafara dan lokaci Asubaabo na
There is no god but He That is the witness of Allah His angels and those endued with knowledge standing firm on justice There is no god but He the Exalted in Power the Wise,Soko jin ri kede ade Tsoci ndocia saide Wyun na to Malaikazhi to eza kpikpezhi nazhie lakugikini be gaskiyae na ade Tsoci ndocia saide Wyuny Etsu nayi Etsu zankpe na Etsu nayi Etsu hikima na
The Religion before Allah is Islam submission to His Will Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other after knowledge had come to them But if any deny the Signs of Allah Allah is swift in calling to account,Akika adini eko izhe le natso Soko jin yeda be yin na Ugayi Musuluncio Za nazhi ma ala litafi ya na ace lebaa saibaci na ilimi da be ya na ebo yangban dede na dan tsakaniabo naZandondo na gae jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhi-na to akika Soko faneba hisabi jino
So if they dispute with thee say I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned Do ye also submit yourselves If they do they are in right guidance but if they turn back Thy duty is to convey the Message and in Allah´s sight are all His servants,A ma ga gbomi be wyo yin wyo gan gan Mia alamari mi laaya Soko to za na maga gba mi na acinga uyio Wyo mao gano ya za nazhi ala litafi ya na to zanazhi ma gbaa ama makaa na Ngba ye yea kpatsun ta ya Soko To akika aga Kpatsun ta ajin shiri dano na ammaa aga bea zuma zheta akika yanna ta eti wyobo na ugayi yanwuo Soko mae cin wuzhizhi le
As to those who deny the Signs of Allah and in defiance of right slay the prophets and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind announce to them a grievous penalty,Akika za nazhie jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhiyna acie wu Annabizhi umayi be hakki ndondo yina na acie wu za nazhie jin zazhi foro ganajin adalinci mini zawangizhio na wyo gaajinoya bushara be azaba na tan sarauyin na
 They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help,Za wuncinzhi gayi zanazhi etunazhi a nyin ya izheo to ekuo nao amaade za nazhia jina taimako naa 
 Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who have been given a portion of the Book They are invited to the Book of Allah to settle their dispute but a party of them Turn back and decline The arbitration,Ngba wyo cin le lo eba zanazhi ala robo ya mini litafi naaEyia ganabea tsun litafi Soko EboUdebaujin hukunci tsakaniabo gancin jamaa ndocizhi miniabo cia zuma zheta zheta acie la pan ya ke gaskiya lugwa
This because they say The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days For their forgeries deceive them as to their own religion,Wuncin ma yi ebo na akika agan Enaadin yi yia saide yan efo nazhi yi bibacizhi na gancin ganmana nazhie tswa na cia ta ke adini jin wangi lugwa
But how will they fare when we gather them together against a day about which there is no doubt and each soul will be paid out just what it has earned without favour or injustice,To ke wuna yiyi nao Yi ga bea kuye kan ya efo natso kelokezhin dana naayino Acia gbata wo ya rayi ndondo yan woce na u ce na amajina zwalunci ekondondo boa
 Say O Allah! Lord of Power And Rule Thou givest power to whom Thou pleasest and Thou strippest off power from whom Thou pleasest Thou enduest with honour whom Thou pleasest and Thou bringest low whom Thou pleasest In Thy hand is all good Verily over all things Thou hast power,Gan gan Ya wyoe Soko na wun mulki kpata na wyoe la mulki aya za na ga ba wyo na wyo mae gwo mulki be za na ga bao nae wyo mae la zankpe a ya za na ga bao na wyo mae gba zana ga bao na alheri kpata egwa wyi bou fio Akika wyode i-ko ta eti yandondo
 Thou causest the night to gain on the day and thou causest the day to gain on the night Thou bringest the Living out of the dead and Thou bringest the dead out of the Living and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest without measure,Wyoe la yeshi a lo dan mini batino igidio wyo mae la batin a lo dan mini yeshio wyo mae wa eyan be rayi a tinya dagan mini eyan tsutsucio wyo mae wa eyan tsutsuci tinya dagan mini yanna yi be rayi-na wyo mae la arziki a ya za na ga bao na umayi be lisafi yina
Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than believers if any do that in nothing will there be help from Allah except by way of precaution that ye may Guard yourselves from them But Allah cautions you To remember Himself for the final goal is to Allah,Muminizhia ga kara la kafirizhi masoyizhi ma zandondo na ma ga da jin acin na za wuncinade kinigiba ndondo ke dan eba Soko boa saide ugafe ebo yede bae tswa mini yezhi be yekan ndociy Soko mae li ye dasun be eti tacinu yin ezhekeba kpata ma beuyin udano
Say Whether ye hide what is in your hearts or reveal it Allah knows it all He knows what is in the heavens and what is on earth And Allah has power over all things,Gan gan Ye ga yannazhi fi yangban yezhio na swo koma yeu tula soko kpeu ye uma kpe yanna fi samazhio to na fi kinbo kpata na ye Soko ma ude i-ko ta eti yandondo
On the Day when every soul will be confronted with all the good it has done and all the evil it has done it will wish there were a great distance between it and its evil But Allah cautions you To remember Himself And Allah is full of kindness to those that serve Him,Efo na rayi ndondoa da tsun etun alheri nazhi ulo na to nazhi ulo dede na wyuna jin guri gan da agaade ekpa na lokpa na tsakaniubo be etun dedeuzhi Soko mae li ye dan be eti tacinuyin gan ye tswa wyin Soko ma Etsu to-sayi uyio be wuzhi zhiy

 Say Obey Allah and His Messenger But if they turn back Allah loveth not those who reject Faith,Gan gan Yea gba Soko ye mae lae gba Tuci Ammaa aga bea zuma zhe ta to akika Sokoe wa kafirizhia
Allah did choose Adam and Noah the family of Abraham and the family of ´Imran above all people,Akika Sokoa Adamu tsa to Nuhu to zami Ibrahima zhi to zami Imaranuzhi ta eti alittazhio kpata
Offspring one of the other And Allah heareth and knoweth all thingsZuriyazhi ayio sashiazhi afe dagan mini sashio Soko ma Etsu nae wo na uyio Etsu na kpe yandondo ye na uyio,

s When she was delivered she said O my Lord! Behold! I am delivered of a female child!- and Allah knew best what she brought forth- And no wise is the male Like the female I have named her Mary and I commend her and her offspring to Thy protection from the Evil One the Rejected,Kamina ubea egi ma na uci gan Tsoci akika miuma yinzagi Soko ma kpe yan na uma na gan wyun tso Egi bagi ma ufe dozhin yinzagia Akika mi mau tu sunna Maryamu egi naa wun Soko gbaugi na mi mae wa tswitswa yau be wyo yin to zuriyauzhi wyo tswaa be egun shetan yin nayi eza cice yaci na
Right graciously did her Lord accept her He made her grow in purity and beauty To the care of Zakariya was she assigned Every time that he entered Her chamber to see her He found her supplied with sustenance He said O Mary! Whence comes this to you She said From Allah for Allah Provides sustenance to whom He pleases without measure,Tsociu ciu gwo gwigwo wangi Uciu lasa sisa wangi Ucia kpikpau laaya ZakariyauKandodo na Zakariyau ga gandan ebau bo masallacio na wyunada tsun yangici zhi eba ubo Uci gan ya wyoe Maryamu!

While he was standing in prayer in the chamber the angels called unto him Allah doth give thee glad tidings of Yahya witnessing the truth of a Word from Allah and be besides noble chaste and a prophet- of the goodly company of the righteous,Malaikazhi ci tami yiu kangama ugi gbaro dan masallacio aci gan Akika Sokoe yao bushara yangban fa be egi na a yi sunnau gan Yahya na namaa gaskiya ya be kalma na fe be dagan eba Soko na umayi edzoshici umayi za lilici umayi Annabi naafe dan mini za guru zhio na

 O Mary! worship Thy Lord devoutly Prostrate thyself and bow down in prayer with those who bow down,Ya wyoe Maryamu! Fe dakpya ya Tsoci wyoe wyo mao feo jin sujada wyo mao feo lo ruku gan ni be za nazhie lo ruku na
This is part of the tidings of the things unseen which We reveal unto thee O Messenger! by inspiration Thou wast not with them when they cast lots with arrows as to which of them should be charged with the care of Mary Nor wast thou with them when they disputed the point,Wuncizhi dan mini labari gaibuzhio nazhi yi swiswoci na yi yejinu wahyi be ya wyoe wyo ma dan tacinabo kamina afe ce kuria be alkallan yinazhi eti zana gakpa Maryamuo naa wyo ma dan tacinabo lokacina afe jin husuma naa
Behold! the angels said O Mary!

And appoint him a messenger to the Children of Israel with this message ´I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord in that I make for you out of clay as it were the figure of a bird and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by Allah´s leave And I heal those born blind and the lepers and I quicken the dead by Allah´s leave and I declare to you what ye eat and what ye store in your houses Surely therein is a Sign for you if ye did believe,Umau laafe Tuci lo eba Banu Israilazhi U ganuya gan kede akika mi be yaye be ayae dagan eba Tsoci yebo Akika mia jin alita yaye dagan eguno ke kotonci elugi na mi cia be efe fiu uci ga zhe elugi be yeda Sokoe Mi mae sa batan yan zana ama be yeboe na to batan yan Soko guny mi mae dan eyan tsutsuci rayi be yeda Sokoe Mi mayae labari yannazhi yegi na to yan nazhi yeswo fi emi yezhio na Akikamini wuncino aya danbo ya ye wunayi Muminizhi ye yio na

 And the unbelievers plotted and planned and Allah too planned and the best of planners is Allah,KafirizhimaA jin makirinci Soko-otso ma gun bea yin be egagba yan makirinciy Soko ga ma gano eba egagba yan makirinci bo
Behold! Allah said O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee of the falsehoods of those who blaspheme I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith to the Day of Resurrection Then shall ye all return unto me and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute,Kamina Soko gan gan Y`a wyoe Isa!

As to those who reject faith I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help,Ammaade zanazhia jin kafirinci na Mia jina azaba na gbota na dan mini izheo to ekuo Ammaade zanazhia jina taimako naa
As to those who believe and work righteousness Allah will pay them in full their reward but Allah loveth not those who do wrong,Ammaade zanazhi ga imani jin na aci lotun wangizhi na Soko ga laadaala ya gungunci Soko mae wa za nazhiejin zwalunci naa
 This is what we rehearse unto thee of the Signs and the Message of Wisdom,Wuncin yie gbaugba ya wyoe dagan mini ayazhio to Tukpa pa naashe be hikimae na
The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam He created him from dust then said to him Be And he was,Akika kotonci yan Isa kendoe Soko jinu naeba Sokouyi ke kotonci yan alitta Adama na Soko jin alitu dagan jikanao gancin uci ganu gan A feucia fe acin
 The Truth comes from Allah alone so be not of those who doubt,Gaskiya de ma dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo wune fe beo Wyo mao gaafe dan mini zanazhie jin shakka na ma
 The Truth comes from Allah alone so be not of those who doubt,Gaskiya de ma dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo wune fe beo Wyo mao gaafe dan mini zanazhie jin shakka na maSurah  If any one disputes in this matter with thee now after full knowledge Hath come to thee say Come! let us gather together- our sons and your sons our women and your women ourselves and yourselves Then let us earnestly pray and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!Za na ma ga gbo mi be wyo yin miniubo na baci yan bayani na be ya wyoe yan ilimi na tganganE dabeyin yi-yi egi yizhi to egi yezhi to yinzagi yizhi to yinzagiyezhi to yitso to yetso gancin yici da kpyi-iya Soko yici ba laana Sokoy ta eti ganmana zuncizhio

But if they turn back Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief,Ama ga bea zuma zheta to akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan za nazhie nyin yan kpata na
Say O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you That we worship none but Allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not from among ourselves Lords and patrons other than Allah If then they turn back say ye Bear witness that we at least are Muslims bowing to Allah´s Will, Gan gan Ya ye za ba litafizhi!

Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing Even in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge It is Allah Who knows and ye who know not!,Ye dan-na ye gbomi dan mini yan na yetso kpe na to kiila ye cie gbomi dan mini yan na ye de ilimi wuna nayino Soko ma yi be kpikpe ye ma kpea
 Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian but he was true in Faith and bowed his will to Allah´s Which is Islam and he joined not gods with Allah,Ibrahimau fe Yahudia Uma fe Nasara ammaade wyunafe eza nae ya pa gaskiyana naa kpatsun ta ya foro Soko na uma fe dan mini za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na boa
Without doubt among men the nearest of kin to Abraham are those who follow him as are also this Prophet and those who believe And Allah is the Protector of those who have faith,Akika za nazhi gwoyin gan eba tsonbao be Ibrahimuy na agayi za nazhia emi tuu nao to Annabi Muhammad na na to za nazhia imani jin na Soko ga ma yi Ndakata yan Muminizhio
It is the wish of a section of the People of the Book to lead you astray But they shall lead astray Not you but themselves and they do not perceive!, Jamaa ndocizhi mini zaba Litafizhio ajin guri naaga ye gbinna a maa gbin zandondo sai de etiatso ammaa afe zanazhie wo sansan wuncin naa

 Ye People of the Book! Why do ye clothe Truth with falsehood and conceal the Truth while ye have knowledgeYa ye zaba Litafizhi! Kila ye cie bo gaskiya keba be ganmana yino ye cie la ganmana swo yetso ma kpe ke ganmana uyio nao,
A section of the People of the Book say Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers but reject it at the end of the day perchance they may themselves Turn back,Jamaa ndocizhi mini zaba Litafizhio ci gan Yea imani jin be yan na acin be ya zanazhia imani jin be Muhammaduina caba yan yigidiy yemae lae jin kafirinci beu yin zobau yin ujin wo be wunciny atsoa dazhin
 And believe no one unless he follows your religion Say True guidance is the Guidance of Allah Fear ye Lest a revelation be sent to someone else Like unto that which was sent unto you or that those Receiving such revelation should engage you in argument before your Lord Say All bounties are in the hand of Allah He granteth them to whom He pleaseth And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things,Ye maega ya gaskiya ma be za na mi tu adini ye na gan gan Akika yan bawu ugayi bawu Soko ye gan wuncin ganebo abe gangan alayan-ya zandocizhi iri natso ala yaye nama koma ebo abe din hujja beyeyin yegboro Soko ma Gan gan Akika falala kpata egwa Soko boo dano Wyune lauya za na ga ba Una Soko ma Etsu bagwo uyio Etsu ilimi uyio

Among the People of the Book are some who if entrusted with a hoard of gold will readily pay it back others who if entrusted with a single silver coin will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding because they say there is no call on us to keep faith with these ignorant Pagans but they tell a lie against Allah and well they know it,Amade dan mini zaba Litafizhio za na wyo ga amana kindari lisafi ewo uyio na gbagbaa na laa yauo laa yao na Amade dan miniabo na wyo ga amana yan dinari ewo degi laa yan na wyuna la yano ya wyoa na sai de wyo gakugikini beu yin kando kando na Wuncin mayi ebo na a ganLefi ta eti yi bo yan yandondo nazhi jin YahuduanaAcie gan gan yan ganmana ta Soko atso ma kpe ke ganmana aye zuno na
 Nay- Those that keep their plighted faith and act aright-verily Allah loves those who act aright,Acin gao zandondo na ga alkawaliu she na uci sundan Soko na akika Sokoe wa za nazhi gae sundanuna na
 As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plighted word for a small price they shall have no portion in the Hereafter Nor will Allah Deign to speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment nor will He cleans them of sin They shall have a grievous penaltyAkika za nazhi-eda shi eyan tetengi izhe be alkawali Sokoe na gan-gani be kutizhia zhi -na zawuncinzhi ade robo ndondo yaa ekuboa Soko maa gangan bea yina U ma cinale be eye yeguny efo Alkiyami yina umaa lia Azaba na ma tan na ga ji tabbata yaa,
 There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues As they read you would think it is a part of the Book but it is no part of the Book and they say That is from Allah but it is not from Allah It is they who tell a lie against Allah and well they know it,Akika amade jamaa ndocizhi dan miniabo ajin afe zhe gintara gba dan bayani Litafio ebo de yefe kpaye ke de bayani yan etun yangban wuncindagan Litafi ga bo u fe beo na alali ma ujin dagan Litafi ga boa Amafe gan gan Egan wuncin dagan eba Soko bo u fe beo alali ma ujin eba Soko bo ufe beo Acie zun ganmana ta Soko atso ma kpe
It is not possible that a man to whom is given the Book and Wisdom and the prophetic office should say to people Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah´s on the contrary He would say Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly,Ugwo-yin ya zawangia ebo na Sokoa litafi to hukunci to Annabci laa yau na gancin uciu feu ganu ya zawangizhi gan Yeazhe wuzhizhi ya mi ke Soko lugwaa Amma na gwoyin wyuna gan nagayi yea fe eza bawta Soko zhi be iri ilimi nazhi ye de fi litafio na to kaatun nazhi yejin na
Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will To Allah in Islam,Uma jin ye umurni gan ye dae la malaikazhi to Annabizhi ela Tsoci zhia Kashi wyuna jin ye umurni jin gan yelaejin kafirinci baci na ye yeazhe musulumizhia ni na
 Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets saying I give you a Book and Wisdom then comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you do ye believe in him and render him help Allah said Do ye agree and take this my Covenant as binding on you They said We agree He said Then bear witness and I am with you among the witnessesWyo mao pa Kamina Soko la alkawali be Annabizhi na uci gan Mima litafi laayaye be hikimae gancin Tuci ci be yaye wyune ya gaskiya be yan na dan be ye yin na Akika ye ga gaskiya ya beuyin ye maa jinu taimako U gan Ngba yeyeu gboka Yema ga gwa sun alkawali Mi ya ye eti wuncino Aci gan Yi yiu gboka Ugan To ye tsoe jin ri Mima dan be yeyin eti eri jino,
 If any turn back after this they are perverted transgressors,Zana zhi-ma ga zuma zheta baci wuncino na za wuncinzhi ga yi fasikizhio
 Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have willing or unwilling bowed to His Will Accepted Islam and to Him shall they all be brought back,Kashi adini ndoci ke yan Soko lugwa gae wa zao Alali ma zandondo na fi samazhio to kinbo na Soko gaata kpatsun yao eti banbao to eti kpakao E ba U gabo ma aku zawangizhi zheban lo
Say We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham Isma´il Isaac Jacob and the Tribes and in the Books given to Moses Jesus and the prophets from their Lord We make no distinction between one and another among them and to Allah do we bow our will in Islam,Gan gan Yi yia imani jin be Sokoe be yan na a cin be ya yina be yana acin be ya Ibrahimae na to Ismaila to Ishaqa to Yakuba to Yagizhi na To yan na a la ya Musa na to Isa to Annabawazhi dagan eba Tsociabo na Yi ma la erikpe ndondo dan tsakaniaboa Yi maafe za nazhia kpatsun ta ya Soko na
If anyone desires a religion other than Islam submission to Allah never will it be accepted of him and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost All spiritual good,Zandondo na ma gada wa ndoci yan Musulunci cigan adini na to a gwo gwauboa za wuncin ma gaafe Efo Alkiyamio dan mini zanazhia jin asara nao
How shall Allah Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them but Allah guides not a people unjust,Ke wuna zhe zhe na Soko ga bawu laaya jamaa nazhi ajin kafirinci be sokoe baci na a imani jin be Sokoe nao A tso ma eri jin ke Tuci Soko gaskiya uyio nao hujjazhi ma da be yaa Soko mae la jama yan Azwalumizhi kr ekoa
 Of such the reward is that on them rests the curse of Allah of His angels and of all mankind,Zawuncinzhi egagbaa ugayi akika laana yan Soko ta etiabo to yan Malaikazhi to yan zawangizhi bae nio
 In that will they dwell nor will their penalty be lightened nor respite be their lot,Amafi bo fi tutun yin ajin sauki azaba yaa a ma pata yaa
 Except for those that repent Even after that and make amends for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de za na zhi ga tuba jin zuma wuncino na acia gyara jin na to akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
Except for those that repent Even after that and make amends for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sai de za na zhi ga tuba jin zuma wuncino na acia gyara jin na to akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
But those who reject Faith after they accepted it and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith- never will their repentance be accepted for they are those who have of set purpose gone astray,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci baci yan imania bo na gancin acie be be eti kafirincio na agwo tubaa za wuncinzhima aga yi eza egbinzhio
As to those who reject Faith and die rejecting- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains though they should offer it for ransom For such is in store a penalty grievous and they will find no helpers,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na har acia tsu alalima kafirizhi ayio na agwo ewo zinari naashe izhe na dagan egwa zaeni ndondo miniabo ka aga ga ewo wuncin laasa etia agwo egwaa boa Zawuncizhima azaba na tan na gaajin tabbata yaa amade za nazhia jina taimako naa
 By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye give freely of that which ye love and whatever ye give of a truth Allah knoweth it well,Ye gade daraja yan bolobolo jina sai ye ga wu dukiyaye dan eko Soko mini yan nazhi yetso gae wa na yandondo na ma ye ga wu na akika Soko yi be kpikpeu yin
All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel Made unlawful for itself before the Law of Moses was revealed Say Bring ye the Law and study it if ye be men of truth,Yangici kpata halali ayio ya Banu Israilazhio sai de na Israiluzhi gaa la jin haramu ya eti tacina shidzo bedzo kafi acin Ataura be na Gan-gan  Ela Attaura beyn ye mae gbau wuna yi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na
 If any after this invent a lie and attribute it to Allah they are indeed unjust wrong-doers,Zandondo na gae tswa ganmana ta Soko na baci wuncino na to zawuncinzhi ga yi azwalumizhio
Say Allah speaketh the Truth follow the religion of Abraham the sane in faith he was not of the Pagans,Gan gan Sokoa gaskiya ta gancin ye mae la mie tu ekpa yan Ibrahima napan ke ganmana lugwa na uma fe dan mini za nazhie la yandoci pa Soko baci naa
In it are Signs Manifest for example the Station of Abraham whoever enters it attains security Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah- those who can afford the journey but if any deny faith Allah stands not in need of any of His creatures,Mini ubo ayazhi danbo nazhia tula na ke kinigiba yan Ibrahima na Zandondo na gagandan bona ugade aminci Hajji ma danbo yan kata Soko ta eti zawangizhio naajin ebo Sokona ya za na ga de kagbo na uga lo bo na Za nama ga bea jin kafirinci ci loa na to akika Sokoa kunke ke alittazhi kpata lugwa
Say O People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah when Allah is Himself witness to all ye do,Gan gan Ya ye zaba litafizhi! Kila ye cie jin kafirinci be aya Soko yino Soko ma Eriko uyio ta eti etun nazhi ye ye lo na bo
Say O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe from the path of Allah Seeking to make it crooked while ye were yourselves witnesses to Allah´s Covenant but Allah is not unmindful of all that ye do,Gan gan  Ya ye zaba litafizhi! Kila ye cie kan zanazhia imani jin na eko Soko yn dao ye cie wa gan yela eko Sokoe lae zhe kinkanci yetso ma erizhi ye yio tati wuncin bo Soko ma yaye ke etun nazhi yelo na lugwaa
O ye who believe! If ye listen to a faction among the People of the Book they would indeed render you apostates after ye have believed!,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ye ga emitu kansan ndocizhi mini yan za na nazhi ala litafi ya na aga ye laazhe kafirizhi baci yan imani ye bo
And how would ye deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs of Allah and among you Lives the Messenger Whoever holds firmly to Allah will be shown a way that is straightKe ma wuna yi yi yeci gaajin kafirinci nao alali ma egba aya yan Sokozhi ya ye Tuciu madan tacinyebo Za na ga wa tswitswa cia egwa fin be Sokoe na akika a zawunci wuba lo eko gboro,

O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E sundan Soko be gaskiyae kendoe ugwo Soko yin na Yemae ga lugwa ajali be la ye ma sai eti kpatsun ta wangi ya foro Soko
 And hold fast all together by the rope which Allah stretches out for you and be not divided among yourselves and remember with gratitude Allah´s favour on you for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love so that by His Grace ye became brethren and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire and He saved you from it Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you That ye may be guided,Ye mae la gwae sun egban yan Soko gbanyin baenio yemae ga kpe kpere kpere ma Yemae fepa mana-mana yan Soko na ta eti yebo na yan kamina ye yea fe makiri dozhi le Soko cia cin cin laadan yangban yezhio gancin yecia tinba yeazhe yegidozhi be niima Sokoena Ye maafe kpe misun gi yan gushe enao Soko cia ye wadzun dagan miniubo Acinga ga Sokoe jin bayani yan aya uzhi yaye yeoujin wo be wunciny ye ga de bawu
Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong They are the ones to attain felicity,Jamaa ndoci mini yebo alaa kuagikinia fea yi zawangizhia lo etun alheri a fe jin zazhi umurni be etun wangizhi amaa fea kangwa yan etun dedezhi Za wuncinzhi ma agayi eza robo zhio
Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong They are the ones to attain felicity,Jamaa ndoci mini yebo alaa kuagikinia fea yi zawangizhia lo etun alheri a fe jin zazhi umurni be etun wangizhi amaa fea kangwa yan etun dedezhi Za wuncinzhi ma agayi eza robo zhio
 Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs For them is a dreadful penalty,Ye mae gaa fe ke zanazhia kpe kpere kperena ma baci na bayanizhi da be yaa ni na za wuncinzhi ma azaba na wancin na wunajin tabbata yaa
On the Day when some faces will be lit up with white and some faces will be in the gloom of black To those whose faces will be black will be said Did ye reject Faith after accepting it Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith,E fona fuska zandocizhi gaafu bokun be haske na fuska yan zandocizhi magashi zhiko za nazhi-ma fuskaazhi gaashi zhiko na a gbinagan gan Beke ye yea jin kafirinci jin baci yan imani yebo na Ebo acino e fe fin azaba ebo yannazhi yejin yan kafirinci na
But those whose faces will be lit with white- they will be in the light of Allah´s mercy therein to dwell ,Ammaa za nazhi fuskazhi a fu bokun be haskena za wuncinzhi gaafe fi mini yegun Soko amafi bo fi tutun yin
These are the Signs of Allah We rehearse them to thee in Truth And Allah means no injustice to any of His creatures,Wuncinzhiaya Soko Zhi ayio yie gbagba ya wyoe be gaskiyae Soko mae kpa zwalunci be alittazhi yina
 To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth To Him do all questions go back for decision,Soko gama wun yannazhi fi samazhio nao to nazhi fi kinbo nao eba Soko ga ma alamari kpata azheban lo
Ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind enjoining what is right forbidding what is wrong and believing in Allah If only the People of the Book had faith it were best for them among them are some who have faith but most of them are perverted transgressors,Ye yea fe alumma na de alheri gan na ala tinya ya zawangizhina yejin zazhi umurni be luilo etun wangi ye mae kan etun na gyea na ye mae jin imani be Sokoe Daaci gan zaba litafizhia imani jin jin da wuncinafe alheri yagan Miniabo ade Muminizhi ekun don doa ma fasikizhi ayio
 They will do you no harm barring a trifling annoyance if they come out to fight you they will show you their backs and no help shall they get,Ajin ye gun woa sai de yan yangban yin Ama gagun ye kun aga zumazhi zheta ye gancin ma ade zando jina taimakoa
They will do you no harm barring a trifling annoyance if they come out to fight you they will show you their backs and no help shall they get,Ajin ye gun woa sai de yan yangban yin Ama gagun ye kun aga zumazhi zheta ye gancin ma ade zando jina taimakoa
 Shame is pitched over them Like a tent wherever they are found except when under a covenant of protection from Allah and from men they draw on themselves wrath from Allah and pitched over them is the tent of destitution This because they rejected the Signs of Allah and slew the prophets in defiance of right this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds,A egba be zunye suny wu kpea etio bandondo na aga tsoa gwa na sai de be alkawali na gboka na dagan eba Soko be alkawali dagan eba zawangizhio Ama zheban be wunzhe dagan eba Soko acia ya ji wu baa etio Wuncin ma yi akika ebo na afe zanazhie jin kafirinci be aya Soko zhiina ama fewu Annabi Soko zhi umayi be haki ndondo yina Wuncin mayi ebo Soko naa le ba na amaafe za nazhi e gbin iyaka tu na
 Not all of them are alike Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand For the right They rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long and they prostrate themselves in adoration,Ajin yenia dagan mini zaba litafizhioade jamaa nazhia kugikini wangi-na egba aya Soko zhi dan mini lokaci yan yeshio ama fe za nazhie dokun be sujada jiny na
 They believe in Allah and the Last Day they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and they hasten in emulation in all good works They are in the ranks of the righteous,Ela imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae a mae jin zazhi foro be etun wangizhiamae kangwa yan etun dedezhiamae dinye dan luilo yan etun alherizhio Zawuncinzhi ma a fe dan mini za guruzhio
 Of the good that they do nothing will be rejected of them for Allah knoweth well those that do right,Etun ndondo na ma aga lo yan alheri na a la egagbau a kanaa Soko ma yi be kpikpe yan za nazhie sundan soko na
Those who reject Faith- neither their possessions nor their numerous progeny will avail them aught against Allah They will be companions of the Fire-dwelling therein for ever,Akika za nzhia jin kafirinci na dukiyaazhi to egiazhi a kunke yaa wo be yandondoe dagan eba Sokooa Zawuncinzhi ma a gayi egi mina zhio
 What they spend in the life of this material world May be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls it is not Allah that hath wronged them but they wrong themselves,Kotonci yan dukiya nae wu dan mini edunfe izhe nanao na u yi ke kotonci efe na yeko fu dan nin yanubo na uci da tswan yandzo yan jamaa ndoci nazhia etitancina jin zwalunci na uciujin hallaka Soko ma jina zwaluncia ammaade eti tacina tso gae jin zwaluncio
 O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks They will not fail to corrupt you They only desire your ruin Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths What their hearts conceal is far worse We have made plain to you the Signs if ye have wisdomYa ye nazhia imani jin na!

Ah! ye are those who love them but they love you not- though ye believe in the whole of the Book When they meet you they say We believe But when they are alone they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage Say Perish in you rage Allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart,Yega dan nao Ye ye waa a mae wa ye yea Ye ma gan yea imani jin be litafiy bae nio Kamina ma aga gun be ye yin na agan Yi yia imani jin Uma gabea ke atso gbaagi a feko gwa ikan eti ye bo ebo takaicio Gan gan Yea tsu be takaicie yin Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio be iri yannazhi fi yangbanzhio na
 If aught that is good befalls you it grieves them but if some misfortune overtakes you they rejoice at it But if ye are constant and do right not the least harm will their cunning do to you for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do,Kamina alheri ndoci gaade ye na wunela yangbanazhia yin egun ndoci ma gaa tswanye ajin afe fa yangban be wunciy Ye ma ga guri jin ye cie sundan Soko tanadi ndondoa la egun tswan ye yea Akika Soko a makezhe be iri etun nazhi elo na 
 Remember that morning Thou didst leave Thy household early to post the faithful at their stations for battle And Allah heareth and knoweth all things,Wyo mao pa Na wyo saka tinya dagan eba iyali wyozhio na wyo cie la Muminizhi shishi dan dannazhio ebo ekuno na Soko ma Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio 
Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice but Allah was their protector and in Allah should the faithful Ever put their trust,Wyo mao pa  Kamina jamaa yan ena guba mini ye bo akpa gan a ga to gbogun na aga zuma ya  Soko ga mayi Ndakata zagubaabao ebo acino Muminizhi de a laa kpea tswo soko 
 Allah had helped you at Badr when ye were a contemptible little force then fear Allah thus May ye show your gratitude,Akika ma Soko jin ye taimako dan ekun yan Badaruo kanga a ye yi gbogun ebo acino e sundan Soko ujin wo be wunciny ye gafe za nazhie jin ye bo ya Soko na

 Yea - if ye remain firm and act aright even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste your Lord would help you with five thousand angels Making a terrific onslaught,Acinga gao akika ye ga akuri jin ye cie sundan Soko kada makirizhi ga be dzun fi ye be girikuy iri nanae Tsoci ye ajine taimako be malaika kpautsuntsun har eda gutsun zhi nazhi maayi be alamazhi na 
Allah made it but a message of hope for you and an assurance to your hearts in any case there is no help except from Allah The Exalted the Wise,Soko ma la wuncin laafea sai de ebo ulauzhe busharau yaye ebo ma yangban yezhia laashi beuyin Taimako ma wune fea sai de dagan eba Soko Etsu na yi Etsu zankpe na Umayi Etsu hikima na
 That He might cut off a fringe of the Unbelievers or expose them to infamy and they should then be turned back frustrated of their purposeEbo wyunula kansan ndoci yan kafirizhiu zun koma wyunu laau sunzunye har atsoa laa zheban alaafe eza zunzunyacizhi ,
Not for thee but for Allah is the decision Whether He turn in mercy to them or punish them for they are indeed wrong-doers,Wyode kagbo ndondo etiaboa sai de wyo wu yan  ko wunaba Soko ugwo tuba najin na wyuna ba Uma ujina azaba Akika azwalumizhi ayio 
 To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth but Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Soko ga ma wun yannafi samazhio nao to nazhi fi kinbo nao wyune fa be za na ga bau na U mae jin za na ga bau na azaba Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio 
 O ye who believe! Devour not usury doubled and multiplied but fear Allah that ye may really prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega gi riba ekpeba dozhi ta eti ekpeba dozhio maye mae sundan Soko ujin wo be wunciny ye ga atswo gurizhi 
 Fear the Fire which is repaired for those who reject Faith,Ye mae tswa ena na Soko jin shiri ya kafirizhi na
And obey Allah and the Messenger that ye may obtain mercy,Ye mae la mie tu Soko be Tuci Sokoe ujinwo be wunciny a gune ye 
And obey Allah and the Messenger that ye may obtain mercy,Ye mae la mie tu Soko be Tuci Sokoe ujinwo be wunciny a gune ye 
Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden whose width is that of the whole of the heavens and of the earth prepared for the righteous,Ye mae dinye dan wiwa yan gafarao dagan eba Tsoci yebo to Aljanna na epeu yi ke samazhi be kin yin naAma jin shiriujin ya zana nazhie gae sundan Sokona 
Those who spend freely whether in prosperity or in adversity who restrain anger and pardon all men- for Allah loves those who do good-Za nazhie wu dukiyaazhi fi eko wangio dan lokaci yan bagwoona to lokaci ba pinyna to za nazhie jin guri acie la fushiazhi nyin na to za nazhie fa be lefi zazhi-na Soko mae wa za nazhie jin bolobolo na ,
And those who having done something to be ashamed of or wronged their own souls earnestly bring Allah to mind and ask for forgiveness for their sins- and who can forgive sins except Allah- and are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in the wrong they have done,To za nazhi Kamina aga etun alfasha lo na ko ma acia eti tacina jin zwalunci na ajin apa Soko na gancin acie ba gafara yan zunubiazhi na Zai ma danbo nae fa be zunubizhi-nao sai de Soko Amae tu gikini ta eti etun lefiazhi boa alali ma atso kpe wo gan ugyea naa 
 For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath- an eternal dwelling How excellent a recompense for those who work and strive,Zawuncinzhi kpata egagbaa yi gafara dagan eba Tsociabo gan ni be emi Aljannazhi-nazhi nuwan eduzhie je fi takoabo na Baga bo maafi tutun yino Madanla be egagba yan zanazhie lo tun wagi na

Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth,Misali yan ekpa wangi wangizhi a shi ye dzoani ebo acino yetsoe daznefi mini kinbo gancin yecie cinelelo iri kendoe zoba ganmana zuncizhizyi na
Here is a plain statement to men a guidance and instruction to those who fear Allah!Nana bayani uyio ya zawangizhi u mayi bawu to waazi ya zanazhie sundan Soko na ,
 So lose not heart nor fall into despair For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith,Ye mae ga to gbogun ma Ye mae ga nyin yangban ma yegazhi yi za nazhi latu gan nao matuka ye de gaafe Muminizhi na 
If a wound hath touched you be sure a similar wound hath touched the others Such days of varying fortunes We give to men and men by turns that Allah may know those that believe and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses to Truth And Allah loveth not those that do wrong,E-ba-yin ndoci gaade ye eba yin iri wuncin de zandocizhi leani efo wuncizhi ma yi yiajin yi fe sanugwasan dan tsakani zawangizhio ebo soko udebau la kpikpeu wu yan zanazhi ga jin imani yan gaskiya na Umaude za nazhiatsu tsutsu yan erizhi na dagan mini yebo Soko mae wa azwalumizhia 
Allah´s object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing Those that resist FaithEbo ma ude bau la sinsan-wangi ulaudan za nazhia imani jin na ke aibi kpata lugwa  U mau la albarkau wauya nakan kafirizhio ,
Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without Allah testing those of you who fought hard In His Cause and remained steadfast,Kashi ye kpaye kpa gan ye ga de gandan Aljannao alali ma Soko lala zanazhie ceko ya Soko mini yebo na wua Uma laala za nazhie jin hakuri na wu be mima cinle yina

 Muhammad is no more than a messenger many Were the messenger that passed away before him If he died or were slain will ye then Turn back on your heels If any did turn back on his heels not the least harm will he do to Allah but Allah on the other hand will swiftly reward those who serve Him with gratitude,
Nor can a soul die except by Allah´s leave the term being fixed as by writing If any do desire a reward in this life We shall give it to him and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter We shall give it to him And swiftly shall We reward those that serve us with gratitude,Umaa ye jin na rayi ndondo a tsu naa sai de be izini Sokoe alkawali uyio naadan kangi be ajali-na Zandondo na ma gae kpa laada izhe be etunyn na Yia la yau dagan miniubo zandondo na ma gae kpa laada yan Alkiyami na Yia la yau dagan miniubo Beleyin ma Yia la egagba wangi ya zanazhi gae jin yeabo ya Soko na 
How many of the prophets fought in Allah´s way and with them fought Large bands of godly men but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in Allah´s way nor did they weaken in will nor give in And Allah Loves those who are firm and steadfast,Dokun dokun mini yan Annabizhio a gunkun dan eko Soko amayi be eza Soko zhi na dokun na nazhi pama bea yin na yangbanazhi ma nakin be iiri yannazhi tswana eti ekpa Soko naa ama to gboguna ama ya tia Soko mae de cincin yan za nazhie jin hakuri na
All that they said was Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything We may have done that transgressed our duty Establish our feet firmly and help us against those that resist Faith,E gana ma ufea sai de egan naagan gan Tsoci yan yi! Fa be zunubi yizhiy to barna eyan nyin nazhi yi yin dan mini alamari yi zhio na wyo mao la bici kinpa yizhio kpe kin wangiy Wyo mao jin yi taimako ta eti jamaa yan kafirizhio 
 And Allah gave them a reward in this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter For Allah Loveth those who do good,Soko ci gaa gba laada yan izhe ganni be bolobolo yan laada alkiyamiy Soko mae wa za nazhi gae jin bolobolo na 
 O ye who believe! If ye obey the Unbelievers they will drive you back on your heels and ye will turn back from Faith to your own lossYa ye nazhia imani jin na! yega mi tu za nazhi jin kafirinci na a ga ye laa zheban da dandan yezhi gancin yeci gaafe eza hasarazhi ,
Nay Allah is your protector and He is the best of helpers,Aa Soko tsayi Ndakata yeyeo wyun ga ma dokun gan eba jinjin taimako bo 
Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers for that they joined companions with Allah for which He had sent no authority their abode will be the Fire And evil is the home of the wrong-doers,Yi ga edo cedan yangban yan kafirizhio ebo eyan nazhie la pa Soko baci nao nama Soko cin hujja ndondo be tia boa na Ezhe kebaa mayi ena Bibi majin tabbata ya ecinba yan azwalumizhi 
Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight of the booty which ye covet Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you For Allah is full of grace to those who believe,Sokoa alkawaliU be ye yin she yaye be gaskiyae lokaci na ye fewu makiri yezhi be izini Sokoe na har da kamina ye bea gbakpan na yecife gbo mi be dozhi eti umurni naala ya ye nao yecia le ba baci na Sokoa yan na ye wa na laawu ye na Ade dan mini yebo za na izhe wyune wazao na amade dan mini yebo zana eku wyue wazao na Gancin ucia ye pan ya kea lugwa ebou ma ye yeu cinule Akika ma Soko fa be lefi yezhiy Soko ma Etsu falala uyio ya Muminizhi
Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground without even casting a side glance at any one and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back There did Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for the booty that had escaped you and for the ill that had befallen you For Allah is well aware of all that ye do,Kamina ye fe gunta eti patio na yema zhe ka kansan cin zandondo lea alali ma Tuci Soko dan batsozhio cie ta mi yiye Soko ci gae-gba be yangban- yiny ta eti yangban yino ebo ye ga nyin yangban eti yan naa fan ye gwa na mao Ye mae ga nyin yangban eti yanna tswan ye na mao Soko mayi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye lo na 
After the excitement of the distress He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings Moved by wrong suspicions of Allah-suspicions due to ignorance They said What affair is this of ours Say thou Indeed this affair is wholly Allah´s They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee They say to themselves If we had had anything to do with this affair We should not have been in the slaughter here Say Even if you had remained in your homes those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death but all this was that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts,Gancin Soko ci cin aminci bea yaye baci yangban nyino ugayi igbe tao naa rukpe kansan ndoci ma miniabo shagala yan eti tacina wunajin shagala acie kpaye natso jin yan gaskiyaa na lo eba Soko iri yekpa yan jahiliyazhi eza rakpezhi Acie gan gan Kashi yide kagbo ndoci de dan mini alamari wuncino Gan gan Akika kagbo yan alamari kpata eba Soko bou dano Acie swo yanzhi fi yangbanazhio natso a la wu wyo yia na Acie gan gan Daa ci gan yide kagbo ndoci de dan mini alamario daa wuyi zhi babon na boa Gangan Ka da ye gafe fi mini emiyezhiakika zanazhi Soko ga wuwu ka ta etiabo na gaa tinya elele baazhio Soko majin nana jin ebo U ma yan nazhi fi yangban yezhio nau cinule ebo ma wyunu la shikan na fi yangban yezhio nau nau ya Soko mayi be kpikpe ya nazhi swo fi yangbano na 
 Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts Met-it was Satan who caused them to fail because of some evil they had done But Allah Has blotted out their fault For Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most ForbearingAkika za nazhi zhe zumata fo na jamaa gubaba keba na akika shetan tsa danakin yino ebo sashi woce dede yan lefi Soko nae ce nao Akika ma Soko fa bea yin Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu hakuri uyio,
O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers who say of their brethren when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting If they had stayed with us they would not have died or been slain This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts It is Allah that gives Life and Death and Allah sees well all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted they would have broken away from about thee so pass over Their faults and ask for Allah´s forgiveness for them and consult them in affairs of moment Then when thou hast Taken a decision put thy trust in Allah For Allah loves those who put their trust in HimEbo yegun ndoci dagan eba Soko wyoe da cici ya da wyo gafe za nae zhewun uma gboka yangban na da agaga- yanaya dagan eba wyo bo Ebo acino fefa beayin wyo mao ba gafarao yaa wyo mao feo jin shawara bea yin dan mini alamario Gancin ma wyo ga niyan gboka eti etuno a yakpe Soko Akika Sokoe wa za nazhi gae yakpe Una ,

No prophet could ever be false to his trust If any person is so false He shall on the Day of Judgment restore what he misappropriated then shall every soul receive its due- whatever it earned- and none shall be dealt with unjustly,Umaa gwoyin na Annabi ndondo a yi eyan jamaazhi naa Zandondo na ga yi eyan jamaazhi na uga yan na uyi na la tinya Efo Alkiyami gancin acia wo rayi ndondo gbata be iri woce na uga ce na amaa jina zwaluncia
Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah Like the man who draws on himself the wrath of Allah and whose abode is in Hell- A woeful refuge!,Ngba za na emitu etun yan yedajin Soko na ugazhe yeni be za nae dingwa da wa ewunzhe yan Soko na ezhe kebau cia zhe jahannama na Bibi ma ajin tabbata ya ezhe keba wuncin 
They are in varying gardens in the sight of Allah and Allah sees well all that they doA wuncizhi darajazhi ayio eba yan Soko bo Soko mae cinale be iri etu nazhie lo na ,
Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah sanctifying them and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom while before that they had been in manifest error,Akika Sokoa eryatwa wanciko laaya Muminizhi ebo Tuci nau tun-tun fia daga miniatso na ucie gba ayauzhi yaa umae taadzu umae la ilimi yan litafi to hikimazhi wua Amaafe shidzo batsozhio dan mini egbin natula nao 
What! When a single disaster smites you although ye smote your enemies with one twice as great do ye say- Whence is this Say to them It is from yourselves For Allah hath power over all things,Kashi kamina ma mimacinle ndoci gaa tswanye na alali ma yetso la iri wuncin guba tswan zazhi lean-ye fe gan gan Dagan babo nna fe beo Gan gan Dagan eba yetso bo ufe beo Akika ma Soko de kagbo ta eti yandondo 
 What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met was with the leave of Allah in order that He might test the believers,Yan na na ma tswan ye fo na jamaa gubaba keba na to be izini yan Soko yino Ebo ma Soko ude bau la mumini yan gaskiyazhiu tu eboa kpea ye 
And the Hypocrites also These were told Come fight in the way of Allah or at least drive The foe from your city They said Had we known how to fight we should certainly have followed you They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal,Ebo ma Ula munafikizhia tua la ezazhia kpeaye ama ci gana gan Edabe ye be gukunedan eko Soko ko ma yela makirizhie nyane tineya Aci gan Yi ga kpe kpe ke ekuna danbo na da yi ga mitu ye fo wuncin a tsoba kafirinci fia gan imani Acie gan gan be misunazhi yan na ujina acin uyi dan yangbanazhi boa na Soko ma de kpikpe gan yan yan nazhie swo na 
 They are the ones that say of their brethren slain while they themselves sit at ease If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain Say Avert death from your own selves if ye speak the truth,Za nazhi- gan ya yegiazhi atso maafe dun na Da aci gan a mi tu yi tu daa a wua Gan gan Yetsoe la tsutsue dagwae yae eti tacin ye yi wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na 
They are the ones that say of their brethren slain while they themselves sit at ease If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain Say Avert death from your own selves if ye speak the truth,Za nazhi- gan ya yegiazhi atso maafe dun na Da aci gan a mi tu yi tu daa a wua Gan gan Yetsoe la tsutsue dagwae yae eti tacin ye yi wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na Surah Think not of those who are slain in Allah´s way as dead Nay they live finding their sustenance in the presence of their LordWyo mao ga kpaye gan za nazhiaga wu fi eko Sokona a tsu ma Aa ayi be rayia yin dan nko Tsocia bo eyaa arzikizhi gi 
They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah And with regard to those left behind who have not yet joined them in their bliss the Martyrs glory in the fact that on them is no fear nor have they cause to grieve,Acie fa yangban be yan nazhi soko la yaa mini eryatwa u zhio na a mae la bushara ya za nazhi laabe tsuna yaa na mini nazhi dan zumaabo na Ke de eyan dansun ndondo dan bo ya a amaale yangban yin ndondo yea
 They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost in the least,Efa yangban be niimae dagan eba Soko ganni be eryatwa uyin Akika ma Sokoe ta laada yan etun Muminizhi yakpea 
Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger even after being wounded those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward,Za nazhi ye yiyi yan Soko to TuciI na baci yan etin nazhi dea na Egagba wanciko maajin tabbata ya za nazhi gae jin bolobolo acie sundan Soko na 
 Men said to them A great army is gathering against you And frightened them But it only increased their Faith They said For us Allah sufficeth and He is the best disposer of affairs,Za nazhi zawangizhi gan yaa gan Akika zawangizhia gun eti yebo ebo acino e sundana wuncin naagan na ci bea imani aci gan Sokoa kunke ya yiyio madanla be Ndakatabo yan Sokoe 
And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah no harm ever touched them For they followed the good pleasure of Allah And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded,Aci zheban daa da be niimae dagan eba Soko ganni be eryatwae egun ndondo ma lagwa toa acia emitu yan na Soko jin yeda beyin na Soko ma Etsu ryatwa uyio na wancin na 
 It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries Be ye not afraid of them but fear Me if ye have Faith,Akika wuncin de egan shetan tsa uyio na wyune laali masoyiuzhi dan na Ebo acino ega sundana ma esundan Mi wunayi Muminizhi ga ye yio na 
 Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief Not the least harm will they do to Allah Allah´s plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter but a severe punishment,Za nazhi-ma eda din yin dan etun kafirincio na ga lugwa wuncin nyin wyoe yangban ma Akika ajin Soko gun wo be yandondo yina Sokoe kpa kpa gan wyuna la robo ndondo yaa efo Alkiyamia Azaba na ma tan na wunajin tabbata yaa 
Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith- not the least harm will they do to Allah but they will have a grievous punishmentAkika zanazhi da shi kafirinci be imani-na ajin Soko gun be yandondoe woa azaba na ma tan na gaajin tabbata yaa ,
 Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith- not the least harm will they do to Allah but they will have a grievous punishment,Akika zanazhi da shi kafirinci be imani-na ajin Soko gun be yandondoe woa azaba na ma tan na gaajin tabbata yaa 
Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity But they will have a shameful punishment,Za nazhi- maajin kafirici na a ga kpa ye kpa gan eta pa na yie la yaa na alheri uyio ya rayiao ma Akika Yie pata pa yaa ebo ade baade bibe yan lefi jin azaba yan egba ma gaajin tabbata yaa
Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now until He separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen But He chooses of His Messengers For the purpose whom He pleases So believe in Allah And His messengers And if ye believe and do right ye have a reward without measure,U fe acin ya Sokoa naUga Muminizhi ya ta eti yanna ye kpe tiubo naa sai de uga erikpe laadan tsakani eyan dedezhi kperi be eyan wangizhi Uma feacin ya Soko na uga gaibu laawuye naa Amaade Soko ajinutsa dagan mini Tuciuzhio zana ga ba una Ebo acino yea imani jin be Sokoe be Tuciuzhi Ye ma ga imani jin ye cie sundan Soko laada na wancin na gaajin tabbata yaye 
And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace think that it is good for them Nay it will be the worse for them soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar on the Day of Judgment To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Za nazhi mae tan yanbo be yan na Soko la yaa dagan mini falala ubo na a ga kpa ye gan alheri wunayi yaao ma Aa sharri wunayi yaao A ma galaa gwoakoro Efo Alkiyamiy Soko gama wun egun yan samazhi to kin yino Soko mayi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi yelo na 
 And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace think that it is good for them Nay it will be the worse for them soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar on the Day of Judgment To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Za nazhi mae tan yanbo be yan na Soko la yaa dagan mini falala ubo na a ga kpa ye gan alheri wunayi yaao ma Aa sharri wunayi yaao A ma galaa gwoakoro Efo Alkiyamiy Soko gama wun egun yan samazhi to kin yino Soko mayi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi yelo na
Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say Truly Allah is indigent and we are rich!- We shall certainly record their word and their act of slaying the prophets in defiance of right and We shall say Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire!,Akika Soko wo egan za nazhi gangan Akika Soko talaka uyio Yi ma eyandecizhi yiyio na Yi ga yan naagan na ka to wuwu maawu Annabizhi umayi be haki ndondo yina na Yi cia gan gan Efe fin azaba ena dindinci 
This is because of the unrighteous deeds which your hands sent on before ye For Allah never harms those who serve Him,Wuncin mayi ebo etun dede na egwa yetsozhi lashidzo nao Akika ma Soko jin azwalumi lo eba wuzhi ndondoa 
They also said Allah took our promise not to believe in an messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire From heaven Say There came to you messengers before me with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for why then did ye slay them if ye speak the truth,Za nazhi gan gan Akika Soko jin alkawali be yi yin gan yi-ga jin imani be Tuci ndondoe ma sai U ga be be dabba zunzunci na enaafe giu na Gan gan Akika Tuicizhi be ya ye shi-midzo ganni be yanna ye gan nae ki-la yecia wuao wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio nao 
Then if they reject thee so were rejected messengers before thee who came with Clear Signs Books of dark prophecies and the Book of Enlightenment,A maga egan wyoe yi ganmana akika a yi egan Tuci nazhi shi wyo dzo na ganmana acin ga a ma be be hujjazhi be litafizhiy ama be be litafi naashe be haskena 
 Every soul shall have a taste of death And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object of Life For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception,Rayi ndondo sai uga egwa ladan ajali daa mi Akika ma aga laada etun yezhi she yaye Efo Alkiyamiy Zandondo na agaa la kpeya be enaena aciu laa gandan Aljannao na akika zawuncinade robo yan egwagan emawo yan edunfe izhe ma ufea sai de kaya etazhi 
Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods But if ye persevere patiently and guard against evil-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs,Akika a mae cin le mini dukiyaezhio to rayiezhio akika ye ma wo egan egunzhi dagan misun za nazhiala litafi ya shi ye dzo nao to eba za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na egan egun na dokun na amma ye ga hakuri jin yeci sundan Soko akika wuncin dan mini alamari nazhi wancin na 
And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book to make it known and clear to mankind and not to hide it but they threw it away behind their backs and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made!,Wyo mao pa lokaci na Soko la alkawali be za nazhi a la litafi ya na kede akika yegaujin bayani ya zawangizhi na ye mae ga swou ma Aciu ceya ci zumaabo aci daa eyan tetengi izhe shi beu yin Bibi majin tabbata ya yanna a shi na
Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about and love to be praised for what they have not done- think escape the penalty For them is a penalty Grievous indeed,Wyo mao ga kpaye gan zanazhie fa yangban be yan na a la laya za na a mae wa gan a jin yebo ayaa be etun na ujin a loa na Ega kpaye gan aga gangwa be azabae ma Azaba na ma tan na gaajin tabbata yaa

 Men who celebrate the praises of Allah standing sitting and lying down on their sides and contemplate the wonders of creation in the heavens and the earth With the thought Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created all this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire,Za nazhie pa Soko gi gbaro to edunfe bao to kamina agayaci cia kansan ya kin na acie kpaye wangi dan jin jin yan samazhio to kin na Tsoci yi!

And their Lord hath accepted of them and answered them Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you be he male or female Ye are members one of another Those who have left their homes or been driven out therefrom or suffered harm in My Cause or fought or been slain- verily I will blot out from them their iniquities and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath- A reward from the presence of Allah and from His presence is the best of rewards,Ebo acino Tsocia ci gwo aduwa nazhia ba na Akika Mi Mie ta etun wangi yan etunloci ndondo ya kpea yan bagi uyio ko yan yinzagi sashi yezhi dagan sashi bo afe tin yao Za nazhi ga jin hijira na a kpe la ebo tswitswa adinio acia yan tinya dagan emiazhio na a majina gun eti eko mi bo na aci gukun a ma wuatsozhi na akika miga etun dedeazhi fin ya yaa Mima gaala gandan Aljannazhio nazhiy nuwan managizhi eje fi takoabo na Nana egagba lada uyio dagan eba Soko Soko ma egagba bolobolo dan beu yin

Little is it for enjoyment Their ultimate abode is Hell what an evil bed To lie on!,Ema wo uyio tetengi gancin ezhe kebaa mayi ena jahannama bibi majin tabbata ya yan-taci wuncin 
 On the other hand for those who fear their Lord are Gardens with rivers flowing beneath therein are they to dwell for ever- a gift from the presence of Allah and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best bliss for the righteous,Ammaade za nazhie sundan Tsocia na ayibe egagba yan Aljannazhiy nazhi nuwan zhie je fi takoabo na Bagabo afi tutun yino ecin ba uyio dagan eba Soko yan nazhi-ma fi eba Soko- na de alheri gan ya eza kirkizhi
 And there are certainly among the People of the Book those who believe in Allah in the revelation to you and in the revelation to them bowing in humility to Allah They will not sell the Signs of Allah for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord and Allah is swift in account,Akika ma ade dan mini zaba litafizhio za naa imani jin be Sokoe na umaajin be yan naacin be yaatso na edakpaya ya Soko ela aya Soko zhi shi eyan tetengi yan izhea Zawuncinzhi ayibe egagba ya ladazhi dan eba Tsociabo Akika Soko Etsu na fan be egagbae na uyio

 With the help of Allah He helps whom He will and He is exalted in might most merciful,Be taimako Sokoe la taimako u ya zae ga ba u nan Soko Etsu zankpe u yio u mayi Etsu yegun
 It is the promise of Allah Never does Allah depart from His promise but most men understand not,Alkawali yan Soko U yio Soko mae le alkawali U baa amma de ekun dondo zawangizhi de kpikpe a
They know but the outer things in the life of this world but of the End of things they are heedless,A yi be kpikpe yan yannan izhe danyninbo yan fili nan a maa ya-ye ke yan nan alkiyami danynin bo nan lugwa
 Do they not reflect in their own minds Not but for just ends and for a term appointed did Allah create the heavens and the earth and all between them yet are there truly many among men who deny the meeting with their Lord at the Resurrection!,Kashi zawangizhi e shi tsuyin a cia kpaye a dan nin yan yangbanazhi boa Ngan Soko jin alita yan sanmazhi to kin to yan nanzhi fi taacinabo naa sai dai eti gaskiyao be iyaka nan yi eyan kpikpeci eba Soko nan Akika ekun dondo mi ni zawangizhio e jin kafirinci be gungun na a da gun be Tsoci a yin nan
 Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them They were superior to them in strength they tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have done there came to them their messengers with Clear Signs Which they rejected to their own destruction It was not Allah Who wronged them but they wronged their own souls,Kashi zawangizhi e zaza kpe eti kin boa ebo a debaa le ye kendoe zo ba yan za nanzhi shia dzo nan yi naa Ngan za pa yin wuncinzhi a gboka gana za gbanizhi a dzo gwazhi fi kin nanao sarawyin ama le izhe nanan gan ken doe za gbanizhi e le u nan Tuci a zhi ma be ya be bayanizhii Akika Soko fe Etsu nan ejin zawangizhi gun naa ammade zawangizhi o tso tsa ejin eti ta cinazhi guno
 In the long run evil in the extreme will be the End of those who do evil for that they rejected the Signs of Allah and held them up to ridicule,Kanga gancin zoba yan za nanzhie lo etun dedezhi nan ci a biebo nan a aya Soko zhi yi ganmanan aci kezhea fe e la aya Soko zhi mi
It is Allah Who begins the process of creation then repeats it then shall ye be brought back to Him,Soko ga yi Etsu nan e ca jinjin yan alitta nano U cie kezhe ye iriuzhi jin Zobao gancin a ga ye ku kezhe da tsun Soko
 On the Day that the Hour will be established the guilty will be struck dumb with despair,Efo nan lokaci alkiyami gaa nan gi gbaro nan kagbo yan zanazhie jin leifi Soko nan gaa ta foga wuna vun-ye
No intercessor will they have among their Partners and they will themselves reject their Partners,A ma de zando tangwa a mini za nanzhi e la pa Soko baci nan boa ebo nan atso ga egwazhi wa be yan nanzhii e la pa Soko baci nae
On the Day that the Hour will be established- that Day shall all men be sorted out,Efo nan lokaci alkiyami ga nan gi gbaro nan efo wuncin zawangizhi ga gansan be dozhii
And those who have rejected Faith and falsely denied our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter- such shall be brought forth to Punishment,Za nan zhi ma a cin mannanbo be Sokoe acia aya Mi zhi ganni be gun-gun naa be gun be Mi yin nan yi ganmanan nan za wuncin zhi a kua ku da zhe fi mini azabao
So give glory to Allah when ye reach eventide and when ye rise in the morning,Edzuta be lili kpata a jin tabbat ya Soko ka mi nan zhi ye gae la shi lozun nan to ka mi nan zhi ye gae la tin ba nan

And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variations in your languages and your colours verily in that are Signs for those who know,U ma ke dan mini yan nanzhi e wu zankpe Soko nan jin-jin halitta yan sanmazhi to kin be erikpe yan ezhimi yan ye zhi be erikpe yan epa nankan kpace ye zhi Akika mini wuncinzhio ayazhi danbo ya za nanzhi de ilimi nan
 And among His Signs is the sleep that ye take by night and by day and the quest that ye make for livelihood out of His Bounty verily in that are signs for those who hearken,U ma ke dan mini yan nanzhie wu zankpe Soko nan ele nanzhi ye le dan mini yeshio to igidiina to arziki Soko nan ye wa za nan Akika mini wuncin zhio ayazhi danbo ya jamaa nanzhie shi tukpa wo egan Soko nan
And among His Signs He shows you the lightning by way both of fear and of hope and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead verily in that are Signs for those who are wise,U ma ke dan mini yan nanzhie wu zankpe Soko nan enansa yan sanmasanmadzwan ka mi nan u ga shi nan nan wune la wuye nan kaminan u gae dzwan nan za ndoci yezhi ajin afe sundan u be nyin eyanzhi ma zandoci ye zhi ma ajin a fe bavun yan ele albarka naa du nan U cia jin u du le zhin dagan sanmao u cie la kin dan rayi be ele baci nan kin ga tsu nan Akika mini wuncinzhio ayazhi danbo ya za nanzhi ga yi eza hankalizhi nan
And among His Signs is this that heaven and earth stand by His Command then when He calls you by a single call from the earth behold ye straightway come forth,U dan mini yan nanzhi e wu zankpe Soko nan shi-shi gikini yan sanma to kin be kagbo yan Sokoe kanga gancin U ga bea ye yi tinya dagan mini kin bo kabari yezhio kpata ye ga tinya dagan kabari yezhio
To Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth all are devoutly obedient to Him,Zaeni ndondo nan dan sanmao to kin bo nan Soko wun yan wuno kpata ma e da kpya ya Soko
 It is He Who begins the process of creation then repeats it and for Him it is most easy To Him belongs the loftiest similitude we can think of in the heavens and the earth for He is Exalted in Might full of wisdom,Wun ga ma yi Etsu nan e ca jin-jin halitta nao U cie kezhe ye u jin be yiye jin yan halitta ma u fan ya Ugan U ma ke de misali yan etun zankpe uzhi nanzhi wancin a maatula dan sanmazhio to kin bo nan wun ga ma yi Etsu zankpeo Etsu nan yi Egba dan jinjin yandondo nan
He does propound to you a similitude from your own experience do ye have partners among those whom your right hands possess to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you Do ye fear them as ye fear each other Thus do we explain the Signs in detail to a people that understand,Soko e la misali ya ye mini eti tacin ye tso zhio ngba ye de dan mini wuzhi yezhio nanzhi ye jin mulki be yin nan nanzhi e pa ye baci eba arziki nan Mi la ya ye nao to ye to wuzhi ye zhi cia zhe ye ni eba Mulkio ye cie sundan wuzhi yezhi kendoe yetso be dozhi e sundan dozhi nan A cinga ga Mi e kpe eganzhi ye ya za nanzhi gayi eza hankalizhi nao
 Nay the wrong-doers merely follow their own lusts being devoid of knowledge But who will guide those whom Allah leaves astray To them there will be no helpers,Lallai za nanzhie jin zwalunci nan etun yangban tsa yi yan nan a la mi tu nao etunazhi da ekpa ilimia Zei danbo nan ga za nan Soko a gbin nan laake eko Akika za wuncinzhi a de za nanzhi a jina taimako naa
So set thou thy face steadily and truly to the Faith establish Allah´s handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind no change let there be in the work wrought by Allah that is the standard Religion but most among mankind understand not,A nakan kpace wyoe ku gikini be jinjin adinii a pan yeshi baenio da ekpa yan gaskiya jin jin yan Soko u yio nan wunajin halitta zawangizhi eti ubo nao Egwa san ndondo ma danbo ya yan nan Soko jin naa wuncin ga yi addini yan gboro amma de ekun dondo zawangizhi a kpea
Turn ye back in repentance to Him and fear Him establish regular prayers and be not ye among those who join gods with Allah-,Yea fe za nanzhi a alamariazhi kpata a ku a kpe tso Soko nan Ye mae fe sundanu ye mae la sallahe kue gikini ye mae ga lugwa yea fe dan mini mushirikizhio nan zhi e la eyan pa Soko baci nan ma
Those who split up their Religion and become mere Sects- each party rejoicing in that which is with itself!,Ye gaa fe dan mini za nanzhi a addinia sa kpere-kpere nan ma a cia fe dan mini ena-enazhio ena ndondo cie fa yangban be nyanu yin
When trouble touches men they cry to their Lord turning back to Him in repentance but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself behold some of them pay part-worship to other god´s besides their Lord-,Ka mi na batan ko egun uga de zawangi zhi nan a fe ti lali ya Tsocia aciga alamari kpata ku a kpe tsou gancin u ga bea yegunU laa twarya ya sashi miniabo a fe za nanzhi e la yan pa Soko baci nan
As if to show their ingratitude for the favours We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy your brief day but soon will ye know your folly,Ebo cin bo yan mannano be yan nanzhi Mi la a twarya ya nan E fe wo-ma izhe beleyin yea be de kpikpeyan egagba emawoezhi eku batsozhio
Or have We sent down authority to them which points out to them the things to which they pay part-worship,Kashi Yi cin egan kagboci ndoci cin be ya U cie gboaka be yan nanzhi e wo a cie la pa Soko baci nan
 When We give men a taste of Mercy they exult thereat and when some evil afflicts them because of what their own hands have sent forth behold they are in despair!,Kaminan Yi ga yegun mana mana la twa zawangizhirya cinle nan a fe fa yangban beuyin amma eyan dede gaa tswana ebo etun dede yan egwa atsozhio kanga a to gbogun be etun Sokoe a yangbanazhi tsu ke yegun Soko lugwa
See they not that Allah enlarges the provision and restricts it to whomsoever He pleases Verily in that are Signs for those who believe,Kashi e cin ba cin lea kede Soko wuna jin U ta yan taci arziki ya zananga ba Una U mae lau yiku ya zanan ga bauna Akika mini etun wuncin nan Wunelo na egwawu yan zankpe Soko danbo ya za nanzhi gaejin imani be etun Sokoe nan
So give what is due to kindred the needy and the wayfarer That is best for those who seek the Countenance of Allah and it is they who will prosper,A hakki yan za nan ga tsoba na laa yau ke dangizhi nan to eza gwa-gbaci to ezan daci nan tati ezano nan Wuncin nan ye ajin nan alhairi u yio ya za nanzhi gae wa yarda Soko nan za wuncin zhi ma ga tso guri be eyan wacia zhii alkiyamio
 That which ye lay out for increase through the property of other people will have no increase with Allah but that which ye lay out for charity seeking the Countenance of Allah will increase it is these who will get a recompense multiplied,Yandondo nan ye ga la ya zazhi ebo u debaulaube u dan mini ewo zazhio nan ke ewo nuwan nan ko shasha nan arziki yezhi a be nko Soko boa Nanzhii ma ye ga la ya zazhi yan zakka nan ye cie wa yarda Soko be a yin nan eza wuncinzhi nanzhi yangbanazhi a tadzu nan Tsoci ga ladazhi kpeba dozhi yaa nan dokun sarawyin nan
It is Allah Who has created you further He has provided for your sustenance then He will cause you to die and again He will give you life Are there any of your false Partners who can do any single one of these things Glory to Him! and high is He above the partners they attribute to him!,Soko ga jin halitta ye yeo U ci kezhe a ye ya arziki Umaa kezhe a ye wu U cia kezhea ye dan rayi Ngba mini yan nanzhi ye wun-za fi izheo nan a de nan jin yandoci wo mini wuncinzhio nan Lili yan baeni be elatui a jin tabbata ya Soko ke yan nanzhi e la pa Soko baci nan lugwa
 Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of the meed that the hands of men have earned that Allah may give them a taste of some of their deeds in order that they may turn back from Evil,Eyan nyina tu la ta eti kin bo to mini eduzhio ebo etun dede nanzhi egwa zawangizhie lo nan Ebo Soko u de bau jina azaba be sashi etun dedeazhii watakila be wunciny a ga egwa kpe etun dede zhio
Say Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before you Most of them worshipped others besides Allah,Gan ya gan e fe za ta eti kinbo ye maefe cinele lo kendoe zoba za nanzhi shi ye dzo nan yi nan Ekun dondoa eyan wo cizhi ayio
 But set thou thy face to the right Religion before there come from Allah the Day which there is no chance of averting on that Day shall men be divided in two,A fuska wyoe eti tacin wyoe ku gikini be jinjin addini nan tso yi gboro na tun efo nan kelo kezhin ndondo danbo eba Soko boana ula bea nan Efo wuncin ga tun zandondo a fe wa tiu wa zawangizhi ga gan be dozhii
 Those who reject Faith will suffer from that rejection and those who work righteousness will spread their couch of repose for themselves in heaven,Zaeni ndondo nan ga cin mannanbo be Sokoe nan zunubi yan kafirciu a wuyan yau Zaeni ndondo na man ga lo tun wangi nan eti tacinatso ga e ta yan taci yao yantaci yan aljanna
That He may reward those who believe and work righteous deeds out of his Bounty For He loves not those who reject Faith,Ebo acino za nanazhi ga imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi nan Soko a gagba be eryatwauzhi Akika Sokoe wa kafirizhia
Among His Signs is this that He sends the Winds as heralds of Glad Tidings giving you a taste of His Grace and Mercy- that the ships may sail majestically by His Command and that ye may seek of His Bounty in order that ye may be grateful,Uma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko Wunajin U tun efe tun ebo u cin-ye yangbanu ta be ele U mau yaye yegunu fin u cinule ebo eya nunwanzhi a fe a dazan be umurni-u-yin ye mae fe wa eryatwa Sokoe za Be wuncinzhii ma ye fe jin yebo e ya Soko
We did indeed send before thee messengers to their respective peoples and they came to them with Clear Signs then to those who transgressed We meted out Retribution and it was due from Us to aid those who believed,Akika yi tun Tucizhi tun shidzo be dzo fi jamaa yanazhi a ma be yaa be bayanizhi kakayin Yi cia lefi jincizhi jin azaba Akika taimako nan Yiajin Muminizhinan tiile u yi ta eti Yi bo
It is Allah Who sends the Winds and they raise the Clouds then does He spread them in the sky as He wills and break them into fragments until thou seest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof then when He has made them reach such of his servants as He wills behold they do rejoice!-,Soko gae tun efe tuno U cie je girgije U cie tau kpe sanmao kendoe u ga bau nan U cie lau safi Wyo ciale ele ye e tinya tatacinu zhio Gancin U ga du ele beya za nan baUna mini wuzhiuzhio Woa lea ye a fe mannin fe fa yangban
Even though before they received the rain - just before this - they were dumb with despair!,A maafe shidzo kafi adu elea yaa nan afe za nanzhi a nyin yangban cia kauna ba be yegun Sokoe nan
 Then contemplate O man! the memorials of Allah´s Mercy!- how He gives life to the earth after its death verily the same will give life to the men who are dead for He has power over all things,Gancin cin le lo be hankalii eba ekpa yan yegun Soko kendoe Wune dan kin rayi dan baci nan u ga tsu nan Hakika egwa wu uyio ke u ga eyan tsutsucizhi kpaata dan rayi nan U ma yi Etsu nan gboka dan jin-jin yandondo nan
 And if We but send a Wind from which they see their tilth turn yellow- behold they become thereafter Ungrateful Unbelievers!,Da a ci gan Yi tun efe tun fia aci da le yangici latiazhi ye wiwoci da agafe zunman wuncino mannanawocizhi
 So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they show their backs and turn away,Akika Wyo la ekun wo gan woa wyo ma la tukpa-tenci wo yiyi woa kamina a ga zunman zheta naa
 Nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying only those wilt thou make to hear who believe in Our signs and submit their wills in Islam,Wyo ma la yebonci za naa gbin nan ke eko woa sai dai za nanzhi ga imani jin be aya yi zhi nan a cia kpatsun ta nan a ga wo egan nan wyo gan nao
 It is Allah Who created you in a state of helpless weakness then gave you strength after weakness then after strength gave you weakness and a hoary head He creates as He wills and it is He Who has all knowledge and power,Soko ga yi za nan ca jin-jin halitta ye dagan gbogunbo nao U ci kezhea kagbo la dan ye baci gbogunbo U ci kezhea gbogunbo laadan ye baci kagbo ganni be ekukui Wune jin kendoe ga baunan Wyun ga mayi Etsu kpikpeo Etsu nan de iko dan jin-jin yandondo nan
 On the Day that the Hour of Reckoning will be established the transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour thus were they used to being deluded!,Efo nan alkiyami ga nan nan eza lemba Soko zhi a zhi kuti gan a le izhe a gan yan lokaci ninia acinga ga uyio kamina a fi izheo nan ganmanan ga afe zun zao
 But those endued with knowledge and faith will say Indeed ye did tarry within Allah´s Decree to the Day of Resurrection and this is the Day of Resurrection but ye - ye were not aware!,Za nanzhiima Soko twarya kpikpe yanan cia gan gan Ngan Ye yaa fe fi mini kabariyezhio mini hukunci Soko har da efo kin-nan ngan yinnan ga yi efo kinnao ammaade ye a fe za nanzhi de kpikpea nan
So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors nor will they be invited then to seek grace by repentance,Fo wuncin za nanzhi ga le izhe yan binankun nan uzuri ndondo nan aga ta nan wunajina amfania a ma ya atso kafa yan uzuri tao tsoa
verily We have propounded for men in this Qur´an every kind of Parable But if thou bring to them any Sign the Unbelievers are sure to say Ye do nothing but talk vanities,Akika Yi yia misali ndondo nazhi a kunke nan la be dan mini Alkuranu nanao ya zawangizhi Ka wyo ma ga be ya be egwa wu yan zankpe ndocii kafirizhi a gan gan akika ye fe yandoa sai dai eyan nyin ci zhi
Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who understand not,Acinga ga Sokoe na yangban yan za nanzhi de kpikpea nao
So patiently persevere for verily the promise of Allah is true nor let those shake thy firmness who have themselves no certainty of faith,A hakuri jin akika alkawali Soko gaskiya u yio Wyo mao ga lugwa za nanzhi jin za gaskiyazhianan lio dan ma 
 These are Verses of the Wise Book-,Aya yan Litafi ALKURANI wuncinzhi ayazhi a yio nane wu egbabo yan ganmisun Soko nan
A Guide and a Mercy to the Doers of Good-,Ba-wu u yio be yeguny ya za nanzhi e jin bolobolo dan etunazhio nan
Those who establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity and have in their hearts the assurance of the Hereafter,A ga yi Za nanzhi e ku Sallah gikini nao a mae-wa zakka yan dukiyazhi a ma kezhea gaskiya ya be efo zobae nao
These are on true guidance from their Lord and these are the ones who will prosper,Za wuncinzhi a ta eti ekpa yan bawuo nan be yaa nko yan Tsociabo nan za wuncinzhi-ma aga tso guri alhairiazhi efo alkiyamii
 But there are among men those who purchase idle tales without knowledge or meaning to mislead men from the Path of Allah and throw ridicule on the Path for such there will be a Humiliating Penalty,Ade dan mini zawangizhio nan wunajin u la ewo dashi egan edzozhi nan ebo ude-bau la zawangizhiu gbinake eko Soko lugwa U ma jin be kpikpe ndondo-yina U ci gau la eyan dzo za wuncinzhi azaba yan zunyesun wunajin tabbata yaa
When Our Signs are rehearsed to such a one he turns away in arrogance as if he heard them not as if there were deafness in both his ears announce to him a grievous Penalty,Ama gae gba aya Yizhi yau wunajin wuna zunma zheta uci ga gbotika ke u wo yannan egan naa-na wyo a ye gan ko kpere ba tukpa-a-bo ba e ta yau ke azaba nan tan sarauyin nan u ga jin tabbata yau nan
For those who believe and work righteous deeds there will be Gardens of Bliss-,Akika za nanzhi a imani jin nan a cie kezhe lo tun wangizhinan Soko-a gaagba be aljannazhiy nanzhiy yi emi niima zhi nan
 To dwell therein The promise of Allah is true and He is Exalted in Power Wise,A ma fi-bo-fi tutunyin akika alkawali yan Soko gaskiya U yio Wun ga mayi Etsu zankpeo Etsu Hikima
 He created the heavens without any pillars that ye can see He set on the earth mountains standing firm lest it should shake with you and He scattered through it beasts of all kinds We send down rain from the sky and produce on the earth every kind of noble creature in pairs,Soko U jin halitta yan sanmazhi ekpo ndondo ma danbo nan kanu gikini ye cia leye naa U ci kezhea patizhi kan-gikini fi kinbo ebo u be du halittazhi ma U ci kezhea dabbazhi iri-irizhi gan-san kpe kin bo Yi ci kezhe du ele be yaye dangan sanmao Yi cia yangici sunsun wangizhi iri-iri yin tinya kpe eti kinbo
 Such is the Creation of Allah now show Me what is there that others besides Him have created nay but the Transgressors are in manifest error,Nan-nan zhiy kpata halitta Soko a yio gancin ebe layannanzhi kutizhi ga jin-nan wuMincinle akika azwalumizhi de a fi mini egbin naatula nao

we bestowed in the past Wisdom on Luqman Show thy gratitude to Allah Any who is so grateful does so to the profit of his own soul but if any is ungrateful verily Allah is free of all wants Worthy of all praise,Akika Yi a hikima la atwarya ya Lukumanu kede unjin yebouya Soko nan Zandondo na gaejin yebo ya Soko nan u jin-jin ebo eti tacinubo za na ma gaacin mananbo be Sokoe nan Akika Soko a kunke ya tiu be dide yandondoe Etsu ma uyio nan e jin yebo ya to kin to fiti o nao
 Behold Luqman said to his son by way of instruction O my son! join not in worship others with Allah for false worship is indeed the highest wrong-doing,Wyo mao pa kaminan Lukumanu fe gan-gan be egiu yin nan U ci fe jinu waazi nan U gan Wye egi-mi! ga kara la yan pa Soko baci ma akika eyan la pa Soko baci leifi u yio nan gbota sarauyin nan
And We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents in travail upon travail did his mother bear him and in years twain was his weaning hear the command Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents to Me is thy final Goal,Yi Soko ma jin zawangi gangba gan wunu tswa yanmanciuzhi gubaba Nnau lau dan ewano gbogun eti gboguno Uma ye-be Nnau mini eya gubao Ebo acino fe jin yebo ya Mi Soko to yanmanci wyo gubaba akika ezhe keba ye kpata eba Mi Soko bou dano
 But if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of which thou hast no knowledge obey them not yet bear them company in this life with justice and consideration and follow the way of those who turn to me in love in the end the return of you all is to Me and I will tell you the truth and meaning of all that ye did,A ma ga dingban be wyo yin gan sai wyoo la yano pa Mi baci be yan nan wyo kpe akika wuna nan ga kara la mi tuama wyo mao fedun beayin izheo eti Bolobolo wyo mao la mioutu ekpa wuzhi guruzhi nanzhi e gba Mi nan Akika Miga yea kezhezhin be wuyan yao Mi cia yae labari etun nanzhi ye fe lo izheo nan
O my son! said Luqman If there be but the weight of a mustard-seed and it were hidden in a rock or anywhere in the heavens or on earth Allah will bring it forth for Allah understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted with them,Lukumanu kezhe a gan be egiu yin Ya wyoe egi mi akika etun dede to wangi kau ga yi gwargwado eyan sunsun nan gbagba gan kpata nan u cia fe dan mini takun wanciko ko mini sanmazhio ko mini kinbo Soko gau ku ke fili Akika Soko Etsu tosayi Uyio Uma de labari yandondo
O my son! establish regular prayer enjoin what is just and forbid what is wrong and bear with patient constancy whatever betide thee for this is firmness of purpose in the conduct of affairs,Ya wyoe egi mi a sallah ku gikini wyo mao feo jin zazhi gangba be etun wangizhi wyo mao nanwun etun dedezhi wyo mao jin hakuri be yandondo na ga tswan wye eti eko nnanonan akika wuncinzhi dan mini alamari nanzhi gbota sarauyin nan
And swell not thy cheek for pride at men nor walk in insolence through the earth for Allah loveth not any arrogant boaster,Wyo mao ga fe cin zunyebo be zawangi zhiima wyo maoga fe dazan alfahri ta eti kin bo ma akika Soko wune wa zandondo nan gae le tiuye cie jin fahri naa
And be moderate in thy pace and lower thy voice for the harshest of sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass,Wyo mao feo dazan yan tatacin ezan hankali wyo mao feo da bere o ci eba egan-gano akika bere nan biye gan kpatanan u ga yi bere tyatyagizhio
 Do ye not see that Allah has subjected to your use all things in the heavens and on earth and has made his bounties flow to you in exceeding measure both seen and unseen Yet there are among men those who dispute about Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without a Book to enlighten them!,Ngba ye cin-le lo zhina kendoe Sokoa yan nanzhiy fi sanmazhio nan to nanzhi fi kinbonan wuna da ci-ci ya ye naa U ci kezhe a mannan- mannanUzhi nanzhiy yi gbangba nan to swiswocizhina laa shekpan ya ye yea Akika a de dan mini zawangizhio za nanzhi e gbomi be hukunci Sokoe u ma de kpikpendoa u ma yi be bawu ndondo yina U ma yi be litafi ndondo nan e wua ba naa nan
When they are told to follow the Revelation that Allah has sent down they say Nay we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers following What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Penalty of the Blazing Fire,A ma ga kezhea gan be a yin gan yea emi tu yan nan Soko cin be nan a gan Aa Yi ye la mi tu yannazhi yi kpeye tsun nda yi zhi etiubo nan Ngba ka wuna yi shaitan gae yi ye lo emi azaba saira natan sarauyinna ye ga emi tuu
 Whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good has grasped indeed the most trustworthy hand-hold and with Allah rests the End and Decision of all affairs,Zaeni ndondo nan ga kpatsun ta ya Soko baenionan U mae dokun be bolobolo jiny nan da-akika za wuncin a egwa laasun egban nan gboka sarauyin nan Zoba yan alamari kpata ma Soko wuno
But if any reject Faith let not his rejection grieve thee to Us is their return and We shall tell them the truth of their deeds for Allah knows well all that is in men´s hearts,Zaeni ndondo na ma gaejin kafirinci nan ga kara lugwa kafirinciu a wyo nyin yangban ma Yi ga a kezhe zhin be tsun kpatao Yi ma ayaa labari yan etun nanzhi a lo kpatanan akika Soko Etsu kpikpe u yio be asiri yan nazhi fi yangbanzhio nan
We grant them their pleasure for a little while in the end shall We drive them to a chastisement unrelentingYi a to gban yaa yan eman wo degi Yi cia kezhe jin a kpaka da gun azaba nan lekpan etan o nan,

 If thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth They will certainly say Allah Say Praise be to Allah! But most of them understand not,Ka wyo ga gbina gan gan Ziy jin alita yan sanmazhio to kin yino Akika a gan gan Soko ga jin ao Gan gan Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko ekun dondo azhi a de kpikpea
 To Allah belong all things in heaven and earth verily Allah is He that is free of all wants worthy of all praise,Yannanzhi fi sanmazhio nan to nanzhi fi kinbo na Soko wunao Akika Soko ga-wun dide kpatao Etsu u ma yio nan alita kpata e jinyebo ya nao
And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean were ink with seven oceans behind it to add to its supply yet would not the words of Allah be exhausted in the writing for Allah is Exalted in Power full of Wisdom,Ka-da u ga fe gan cigban nanzhi fi kinbo kpata nan a zhe alkalamizhi edu izhe kpata u laukeba u ciu lauzhe tadawa a cia kezhea la edu iriu gutwaba a beu be afea ka bayani yan egan misun Soko to alkalamizhi to tawadazhi kpata ga zo egan misun yan Soko a zoa Akika Soko Etsu zankpe u yio Egba ma u yio dan jin-jin yandondo
And your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individual soul for Allah is He Who hears and sees all things,Jin-jin nan Soko jin alitta yezhi kpata nan to ekin nan wuna nanye kabari ye zhiona u -- eka yan jin-jin rayi nini gana Akika Sokoe wo u mae le ye
 Seest thou not that Allah merges Night into Day and he merges Day into Night that He has subjected the sun and the moon to his Law each running its course for a term appointed and that Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Ye le yea kede akika Soko ga yi Etsu nan e la yeshi a lo dan batino naa U mae kezhe la batin a lo dan yeshio naa U ci kezhea igidi to etswa jin foro ndondoa edazan eti eka nan Soko ba yau nan Akika Soko de labarikpikpe yan etun nanzhi ye lo kpata nan
That is because Allah is the only Reality and because whatever else they invoke besides Him is Falsehood and because Allah- He is the Most High Most Great,Wuncinzhi kpata-ma e wu gwa ke de Soko tsa yi Etsu gaskiyao nao akika ma yandondo nan alitazhie wun baci Soko nan ganmanan u yio Akika ma Soko ga yi Etsu nan-wun elatu nao U ma yi Etsu nan wancin nan
Seest thou not that the ships sail through the ocean by the Grace of Allah- that He may show you of His Signs Verily in this are Signs for all who constantly persevere and give thanks,Wyo le yea Kede eya nuwanzhi e dazan-da kpe eti eduo be ni-ima Soko yina ebou de-bau wugwa zankpeu mini zankpe uzhi boa Akika mini yan wuncinzhio egwa wu yan zankpe Soko danbo ya zandondo nan ga yi eza hakuri nan U ma ekezhe jin yebo ya Sokonan
When a wave covers them like the canopy of clouds they call to Allah offering Him sincere devotion But when He has delivered them safely to land there are among them those that halt between right and wrong But none reject Our Signs except only a perfidious ungrateful wretch!,Kaminan egban yan nuwan ga rukpea na ke girgijezhi nan kanga afe yi Soko ye a ci ga yangban tadzu dan yiyi nan e yiu nao gancin u gaa wadzun dazhin kosun kanga a de za kirkizhi miniabo Akika a de za na agbomi be aya Sokoe naa sai za nan e ta ti u nan u mae cin mannan bo nan
 O mankind! do your duty to your Lord and fear the coming of a Day when no father can avail aught for his son nor a son avail aught for his father Verily the promise of Allah is true let not then this present life deceive you nor let the chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah,Ya ye zawangizhi e fe sundan efo wanciko-ko efo nan yanmanci wuna kunkewo ya egi wunanan egi o tso ma wuna kunke ya yanmanciu wo be yando yina nan Akika alkawali yan Soko gaskiya u yio ebo acino e ga lugwa eman-izhe ta ye ma ye mae ga lugwa za nanzhi e ta zazhi ke eko Soko lugwa nan ta ye ma
 Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah alone It is He Who sends down rain and He Who knows what is in the wombs Nor does any one know what it is that he will earn on the morrow Nor does any one know in what land he is to die Verily with Allah is full knowledge and He is acquainted with all things,Akika eba Soko bo kpikpe yan ekina alkiyami dano Soko ga ma e du leo wun ga ma kpe yan nanzhi so fi ewanzhio nao rayi-ndondo ma kpe yan naa tswanu esun naa rayi-ndondo ma kpe kin na wuna tsu dan naa akika Soko tsa wun kpikpeo U ma de labari yandondo

 He rules all affairs from the heavens to the earth in the end will all affairs go up to Him on a Day the space whereof will be as a thousand years of your reckoning,Soko ga e la ye dan alamarizhi kpatao dagan sanmao har da kin Gancin alamarizhi e gun da tsunu dan mini foenio nan ekau yi eya kpautsun eba lisafi ye zawangizhio nan
Such is He the Knower of all things hidden and open the Exalted in power the MercifulSoko ,Wuncin ga yi Etsu nan wun kpikpe yan nan so nao to yan nan tula nao Etsu zankpe u yio Etsu yegun u yio
 He Who has made everything which He has created most good He began the creation of man with nothing more than clay,Etsu nan a bolobolo laadan yandondo nan u jin alitaunan U cia alita yan zawangi cayn jin be eguny
 And made his progeny from a quintessence of the nature of a fluid despised,U ci kezhea zuriya u zhi jin e tinya dagan nuwan kinkinci nan ma yi gbogun nan
 But He fashioned him in due proportion and breathed into him something of His spirit And He gave you the faculties of hearing and sight and feeling and understanding little thanks do ye give!,U ciu ta wangiy U ci be efe fiu dagan rayi wuntso U cia ganwo to bacinle to yekpa la a ya ye Akika eza de gi mini ebo gaejin yebo ya Soko
And they say What! when we lie hidden and lost in the earth shall we indeed be in a Creation renewed Nay they deny the Meeting with their Lord, A ci gan Ngba yi gagbin ruku cia gbin fi kinbo aga alita yi ye jin woroe be Akika a dea fe za nanzhi e jin kafirinci be gungun ayin be Tsocia yin nae
 If only thou couldst see when the guilty ones will bend low their heads before their Lord Our Lord! We have seen and we have heard Now then send us back to the world we will work righteousness for we do indeed now believe,Da aci gan wyoa le leifi jincizhi ye le kendoe a yati shi kin bo yegboro Tsocia bo nan a cia gan gan Tsoci yan yi akika yia gaskiya leye gancin yi ma wo egan wyo zhi wangi ebo acino a yi kezhe la da izhe yia da lotun wangiwangizhi akika yia gaskiya ya yan baeni
If We had so willed We could certainly have brought every soul its true guidance but the Word from Me will come true I will fill Hell with Jinns and men all together,U ma ga ba yiba yi ga bawu yan rayi ndondo la ayau ammade gaskiya yan egan Mi wuna fedunani kede Mi ga jahannama she pinyin be aljannuzhi to zawangizhi baenionan
Taste ye thenfor ye forgot the Meeting of this Day of yours and We too will forget youtaste ye the Penalty of Eternity for your evil deeds!,A cia fe gana gan e fe fin azaba ebo tanba nanlo ye be efo gungunyekan yan ye nannane nan akika yi tsoa ye batan efe fin azaba nan yea dzunbo beanan ebo etun dede nanzhi ye fe lo nan
Only those believe in Our Signs who when they are recited to them fall down in prostration and celebrate the praises of their Lord nor are they ever puffed up with pride,Akika za nanzhi e jin imani be aya Yizhi nan a ga yi za nanzhi a ga sanatu beu yin nan ajin a etiazhi ya shi kinbo eti ekpeadao ya Soko nao a cia fe li Soko tsatsayin gan ni be yebo jiny ya Tsocia a man jin za nanzhi e gbotika naa
Their limbs do forsake their beds of sleep the while they call on their Lord in Fear and Hope and they spend in charity out of the sustenance which We have bestowed on them,Kansan yan nakan kpaceazhi a kpeya be elelebazhi ebo ekundo yan nafila yeshio e jin bawta ya Tsocia be danwoe yan azaba ganni be kauna yan aljanna a mae kezhe wu dukiyazhi nan Soko la ayanan fi eko wangizhio
 Now no person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden in reserve for themas a reward for their good deeds,Akika a de rayi nan kpe iri yan nanzhi Soko jin shiri swiswoci kau yan eman wozhi naa wuncinzhi ma egagba u yio yan etun wangizhi nanzhi a fe lo kaminan adan izheo nan
 Now no person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden in reserve for themas a reward for their good deeds,Akika a de rayi nan kpe iri yan nanzhi Soko jin shiri swiswoci kau yan eman wozhi naa wuncinzhi ma egagba u yio yan etun wangizhi nanzhi a fe lo kaminan adan izheo nan
 Is then the man who believes no better than the man who is rebellious and wicked Not equal are they,Ngba za nan a fe Mumini nan u ga ye la a santatu be za nanyi fasiki eza lefi Soko nan Aa za nannanzhi a fe yannia
For those who believe and do righteous deeds are Gardens as hospitable homes for their good deeds,Za nanzhi ga gaskiya ya be Sokoe nan a cie lotun wangizhi nan ecinba yan Aljannazhi ga jin tabbata yau Ecinba u yio ebo etun wangizhi nanzhi a fe lo izheo nan
As to those who are rebellious and wicked their abode will be the Fire every time they wish to get away therefrom they will be forced thereinto and it will be said to them Taste ye the Penalty of the Fire the which ye were wont to reject as false,Ammaa za nanzhi e le Soko ba nan ezhe kebaa yi enan ka ndondo nana ga kpa kezhe fi bo a cia gana gan e fe da fin azaba yan enan nan ye fe yi ganmanan izheo nan
And indeed We will make them taste of the Penalty of this life prior to the supreme Penalty in order that they may repent and return,Akika ma Yia yaa azaba tetengitso fin izhe babonnao kafiy azaba wancikotso yan alkiyami nan ebo a laa lo ankaliazhi a laa gan be etun sakpazhi
 And who does more wrong than one to whom are recited the Signs of his Lord and who then turns away therefrom Verily from those who transgress We shall exact due Retribution,Ngba zeyti binankun a gan za nan a pau tukpa be ganmisun yan Sokoe U cia zunma zhetau nao Akika leifi jincizhi ga gbataa wo
 We did indeed aforetime give the Book to Moses be not then in doubt of its reaching thee and We made it a guide to the Children of Israel,Akika yi la litafi ya Annabi Musa ga jin kelokezhin ndondo be gungun wyo yin beu yin ma Yi mau la a fe bawu ya jama yan Bani Israilazhi
 And We appointed from among them leaders giving guidance under Our command so long as they persevered with patience and continued to have faith in Our Signs,Yi ma li dzo shicizni miniabo nanzhi e wu zazhi ba be umurni yi yin nan ebo hakuri nanzhi a fe jin nan a maa gaskiya ya be aya Yizhiy nan
 Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment in the matters wherein they differ among themselves,Akika Tsoci wyoe U gaa jin hukunci tsakaniabo be dozhi efo alkiyami eti yan nanzhi e la ce dozhi leba izeo nao
Does it not teach them a lesson how many generations We destroyed before them in whose dwellings they now go to and fro Verily in that are Signs Do they not then listen,Ngba U gaa fe ekpa yan bawu yaaa Kendo yia ekundondo yan alum mazhi nazhi shiadzonan jin hallaka naa ngan a tso fe jin dalodazin fi mini emiazhio Akika mini alamari wuncinzhio sisantuzhi dan bo be egwawu yan zankpe Sokoe Kiy jinao kashi e wo gan woa
And do they not see that We do drive rain to parched soil bare of herbage and produce therewith crops providing food for their cattle and themselves Have they not the vision,Kashi a le ba ye laa kede Yi gaa je nuwan lo kin naawo kpakparae naa Gancin Yi ci e la yangici sunsunzhi tinya dangan kin wuncino nanzhiy to a gi naa Kiy jina acie kpayea yino
 They say When will this decision be if ye are telling the truth,A ci e gan gan fo ci efo hukunci nannan a yio wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio naao
 Say On the Day of Decision no profit will it be to Unbelievers if they then believe! nor will they be granted a respite,Gan yaa gan Efo hukunci wuncin Imani yan za nanzhi a jin a jin kafirinci be Sokoe nan wuna jina anfania
So turn away from them and wait they too are waiting,Annabi Dzun gana bo Wyo maofeotu alamari Soko oye akika to atso dan yetuo ma
O Prophet! Fear Allah and hearken not to the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites verily Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom,Ya Wyoe Annabi Sundan Soko Wyo maoga la mi tu kafirizhi be munafikizhiy ma Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe u yio Egba ma u yio dan jin-jin yandondo
But follow that which comes to thee by inspiration from thy Lord for Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do,Wyo ma o la mi o tu yan nan e la wahyiu be ya wyoe dagan nko Tsoci o bo nan Akika Soko yi be labari etun nanzhi ye lo nan
And put thy trust in Allah and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs,Wyo mao la o yaokpe Soko Akika Soko a kunke Etsu nan ezaayakpe nan
Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his one body nor has He made your wives whom ye divorce by Zihar your mothers nor has He made your adopted sons your sons Such is only your manner of speech by your mouths But Allah tells you the Truth and He shows the right Way,Soko la yangban guba dan nin yan nakankpace zaeni ndondo ye boa Yinmi yezhi nanzhi ye laa san-tatu be miman yezhiynan a jin Nnan yezhia egi kpaci yezhi ma a jin Nnan yezhia egi kpaci yezhi ma a jin egi gbako yezhia wuncinzhi nanzhi ye gan nan egan-dagan tsa u yio nan e tin ya misun yezhio nan Soko ga yi Etsu nan e ta gaskiya nao Wun ga mae wu alitazhi ba lo eko guruo
Call them by the names of their fathers that is juster in the sight of Allah But if ye know not their father´s names call them your Brothers in faith or your maulas But there is no blame on you if ye make a mistake therein what counts is the intention of your hearts and Allah is Oft-Returning Most Merciful,Efe yi egi kpaci yezhi da ba Babazhi wuncin ga yi gboro eba Soko bo Ka gan ye kpe Baba azhi yea Yea la yegi yezhi mini adinio a ma ke yi egi yan yegi yezhi Leifi ma tati yeboa mini yan nanzhi ye ga jin eti bicicino naa sai dai yan nan yangban yezhi jin eti digangao nan Akika Soko Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegun ma u yio
The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves and his wives are their mothers Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties in the Decree of Allah Than the Brotherhood of Believers and Muhajirs nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends such is the writing in the Decree of Allah,Annabi ga -- yin gan ya Muminizhi nan a ga la mi tu foro uzhi a gan yan ti tacin atsozhi nao Yinminuzhi ma Nnaazhi a yio Dangi yan mimazhi man sashiazhi tsoba dozhi gan sashi mini hukunci Soko a ma ke tsoba gan tsonba yan Muminizhi be Muhajiruna zhiy eba egun gio sai dai u ga be ba ye ci jin alhairi ya masoyiyezhi muminizhi Wuncinzhi ma eyan kikacizhi a yio dan mini Litafio
And remember We took from the prophets their covenant As We did from thee from Noah Abraham Moses and Jesus the son of Mary We took from them a solemn covenant,Annabi Wyo mao pa ka mi nan Yi la alkawalizhi be Annabi Soko zhiy nan eti eyan-wu wangio Yi ma la be wyo tsoe Yi ma ke la be Nuhuy to Ibrahima to Musa to Isa egi yan Maryamae Akika Yi la alkawali nan le kpan nan bea yin
That Allah may question the custodians of Truth concerning the Truth they were charged with And He has prepared for the Unbelievers a grievous Penalty,Ebo Soko u de ba ugbin za gaskiyazhiu gan eti akika yan gaskiya boabo Soko ma azaba na tannan jin shiri ka kafirizhi
O ye who believe! Remember the Grace of Allah bestowed on you when there came down on you hosts to overwhelm you But We sent against them a hurricane and forces that ye saw not but Allah sees clearly all that ye do,Ya ye nanzhi gaskiya ya be sokoe nan e fe pa boye yan Soko nan tula ya ye kaminan ekun guncizhi dzun fi ye nan Yici tun efe-ko fia ganni be ekunguncizhi Nanzhi ye tswo le yea nan Akika Soko-e cin ye le be iri etun nanzhi ye lo nan
 Behold! they came on you from above you and from below you and behold the eyes became dim and the hearts gaped up to the throats and ye imagined various vain thoughts about Allah!,Kamina a be dzun fi ye dagan ti-fin to tako ye bo nan Kanga ma eye yezhi a dayi dansun ma ashe yangban yezhi da iyaka ye ma fe kpayezhi kakayin be alamari Sokoe
In that situation were the Believers tried they were shaken as by a tremendous shaking,Baga gabo a man Muminizhi cin le-o aci dua du-du nan gboka sarauyin nan
And behold! The Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease even say Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!,Kaminan Munafikizhi to zanazhi imaniazhi a togbogun nan a fe da gan gan gan Soko be Tuciu yin jin yi alkawali ndondoa sai dai tita
 Behold! A party among them said Ye men of Yathrib! ye cannot stand the attack! therefore go back! And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet saying Truly our houses are bare and exposed though they were not exposed they intended nothing but to run away,To kaminan jamaa ndocizhi miniabo gan gan Ya ye Madina cizhi ye de edun a fea shi yegboro Annabi boa ebo acino ekezhe da emi ezhi Zandocizhi miniabo ci fe wa izini be Annabi a fe gan gan Akika emi yizhi a fan yavun zando danbo a -- u tswaa ganmannan ma e zuno emiazhi fan yavuna a kpa yandondoa sai eci nan a bi ke ekun lugwa nan
 And if an entry had been effected to them from the sides of the city and they had been incited to sedition they would certainly have brought it to pass with none but a brief delay!,Da aga gan-gan fia Kansan ta ndondo aci wa be ayin gan a la egun a la a tswan addini a a ga yarda jin Wuncin man u laa le izhe lokpa woa sai yan lokaci degi nan Soko ga yaa nan
And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their backs and a covenant with Allah must surely be answered for,Akika ma shidzo batsozhio munafiki nnazhi a jin Soko alkawali ke yea ya zunmanan akika ma alkawali Soko eyan uyio nan aa gbina 
Say Running away will not profit you if ye are running away from death or slaughter and even if ye do escape no more than a brief respite will ye be allowed to enjoy!,Gan ya gan ecibi wunajine amfania ye ga bici tsutsu ko ekun na Ye maa woma izhe a gan yan lokaci degia
Say Who is it that can screen you from Allah if it be His wish to give you punishment or to give you Mercy Nor will they find for themselves besides Allah any protector or helper,Gan ya gan Zei danbo nan a -- ye tswa be Sokoe nao kamina Soko ga kpa ye be azabae ko be yeguny nap Ye maade Ndakata ko taimako jin-ci a -- Soko gana
 Verily Allah knows those among you who keep back men and those who say to their brethren Come along to us but come not to the fight except for just a little while,Akika Soko kpe za nanzhi e to alamarizhi gbogun nan ye mini yebo to za nanzhie gan be yegiazhi-gan e dazhin be tsun yi nan A tso man e lo ekun gunzhia sai degi miniabo
Covetous over you Then when fear comes thou wilt see them looking to thee their eyes revolving like those of one over whom hovers death but when the fear is past they will smite you with sharp tongues covetous of goods Such men have no faith and so Allah has made their deeds of none effect and that is easy for Allah,Za nnazhiy gaela taimako tanye yanbo gancin eyan dansun ga dzun fia wyoa le eyeazhi ye fe danyi ke za nan tsutsu a rukpe u nan Kaminan eyan dasun gala keya nan a fe gan ye Muminizhi yin be gintara dedeazhi Eza zhi a yio nanzhi e tanyanbo be alhairiy nan Za wuncinzhi a ya gaskiya be Soko yina Soko cia etunazhi gbin ya Wuncin ma yannan fan nan u yi eba Soko bo
 They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn and if the Confederates should come again they would wish they were in the deserts wandering among the Bedouins and seeking news about you from a safe distance and if they were in your midst they would fight but little,E kpaye kpa gan jamaa kungunci yan kafirizhi laa loa jamaa wuncinzhi ma ga ke da zhin wuna ba munafikizhi gan wunayi ezhitizhi boafio na Ebo afea gbingan laabari ye Musulumizhiaza Kaa munafikizhi gadan ganni be yiyin aa baye ekun gunre be kafirizhi yina sai dai degi miniabo
Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern of conduct for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day and who engages much in the Praise of Allah,Akika ye de yesan wangi dan mini yan Tuci Soko nan yea sanye nan ya zandondo nan gaejin kauna Soko be egagba wangi efo zobae nan u mae kezhe tun Soko ye dokun nan
 When the Believers saw the Confederate forces they said This is what Allah and his Messenger had promised us and Allah and His Messenger told us what was true And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience,Kamnan Muminizhi le jamaa kungunci yan kafirizhi ye nan a gan nan-nan gayi alkawali nan Soko be Tuciu yin jin yi nao akika Soko be Tuciu yin ma a gaskiya ta wuncin ma bea yandondoa sai dai imani ganni be kpatsun ta ya Sokoe
Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah of them some have completed their vow to the extreme and some still wait but they have never changed their determination in the least,Mini Muminizhio bagizhi danbo nanzhi wugwa gaskiya eti alkawali nanzhi ajin be Sokoe nan Ade nanzhi efoazhi a zoani nan a ma de nanzhi e tu efo ajaliazhi ye nan a ma la gwasan ndondo dan alkawaliazhi boa
 And Allah turned back the Unbelievers for all their fury no advantage did they gain and enough is Allah for the believers in their fight And Allah is full of Strength able to enforce His Will,Soko a kafirizhi yan daa zunma gan-ni be ewunzheazhiy a ma tso guri alhairi ndondoa Soko cia kunke ya Muminizhi be ekunguny akika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe ma uyio
And those of the People of the Book who aided them - Allah did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts So that some ye slew and some ye made prisoners,Soko cia zanazhi jin kafirizhi taimako mini za ba litafizhio nan cin ke ekpoazhi lugwa U cia gan be kagboazhi ucia edo laashe yangbanazhi Ebo wuncino ye fe wu zandocizhi miniabo ye ma fe wan ndocizhi wuzhizhi
 And He made you heirs of their lands their houses and their goods and of a land which ye had not frequented before And Allah has power over all things,Soko cia kin yanazhi to emiazhi to dukiyazhi gi-gun ya ye to kin ndoci otso nan bici yezhi laa pabo leanan kpata wuna laa gigun ya ye Akika Soko gboka eti jin jin yandondo
O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts If it be that ye desire the life of this World and its glitter- then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and set you free in a handsome manner,Ya wyoe Annabi a gan be yinmin wyozhi gan Wunayi eman yizhe be eyan ninpauzhiy ga ye wa gano e da be Mia yae eman wo Mi ma gaa gan be yin gingan nan yi wangi nan
But if ye seek Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter verily Allah has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward,Uma-yi Soko to Tuciu to emi yan zoba wangi u ga ye wao akika Soko jin shiri yan egagba wanciko ya za kirikizhi mini yebo
O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct the Punishment would be doubled to her and that is easy for Allah,Ya ye yinmin Annabi zhi zaeni ndondo nan ga da lotun sakpa miniebo nan har ucia tula nan a ga azaba kpeba dozhi yaa har guba jin-jin wuncin ma eyan finfanci uyi eba Soko bo
But any of you that is devout in the service of Allah and His Messenger and works righteousness- to her shall We grant her reward twice and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance,Zaeni ndondo miniebo nan ga cin dan jin-jin ibadao ebo Soko be Tuciu yin nan U cie kezhe lotun wangi wangizhi nan Yi ga ladau laayau har zuguba Yi ma ga arziki nan wancin nan jin shiri kau
 O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the other women if ye do fear Allah be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire but speak ye a speech that is just,Ya ye yinmin Annabi zhi akika Kinigiba ye U jin nini be yan ynzagi ndondo yina ye gae sundan Soko sun ga e ga fe kan bere nuwan eba egan gano ma har nan zandoci nan yi be batan yangbanena wuna de shahawa nan Ye mae fe gangan wangi kendoe bere yezhi yi nan
And stay quietly in your houses and make not a dazzling display like that of the former Times of Ignorance and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity and obey Allah and His Messenger And Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you ye members of the Family and to make you pure and spotless,Ye mae fedun efi emi yezhio ye mae ga fe dzun tinya kendoe gberi yan paayin zhi fe tinya nan-ma dzun-dzun tinya be ninpae Ye mae la sallahe kue gikini Ye mae fe wa zakka dukiya yezhi ye mae fe gba Soko be Tuciu yin Akika Sokoe kpa-kpa gan u la ye yiu gan be shikan kpatae Ye za mi Annabi zhi U mau la ye yiu li lili yan baeni
And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes of the Signs of Allah and His Wisdom for Allah understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted with them,Ye mae fe pa aya Soko nanzhi e gba wu ye emi ye zhio nan be Hadisizhiy Akika Soko Etsu tosayi u yio Etsu kpikpe uyio
 For Muslim men and women- for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in Charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in Allah´s praise- for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward,Akika Musulumi bagi to Musulumi ynzagizhi to Mumini bagizhi to Mumini ynzagizhi to bagi nanzhi acin dan ibada jino nan to ynzagi nanzhi a cin dan ibada jino nan to bagizhi nanzhi yi za gaskiyazhi nan to bagi nanzhi e jin hakuri nan to ynzagi nanzhi e jin hakurinan to bagi nanzhie dakpya nan to ynzagi nanzhie dakpya nan to bagi nanzhi ejin sadaka nan to ynzagi nanzhie jin sadaka na to bagi nanzhie fe azun nan to ynzagi nanzhie fe azun nan to bagi nanzhie tswa kaafaazhi nan to ynzagi nanzhie tswa kaafaazhi nan to bagi nanzhi e tun Soko ye dokun nan to ynzagi nanzhi gae tun Soko ye dokun nan kpataa Soko jin shiri yan gafara be laada nan wancin nae yaa
 It is not fitting for a Believer man or woman when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path,U -- yin ya Mumini bagi to Mumini ynzagia kaminan Soko be Tuciuyin ga hukunci ba eti alamari ndocio nan nan aada wa etsa ndoci ke alamari Soko lugwa naa Zaeni-ndondo nan gae le Soko be tuciu yin banan akika za wuncin a gbin egbin na tso a tula nan
 Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour Retain thou in wedlock thy wife and fear Allah But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest thou didst fear the people but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah Then when Zaid had dissolved his marriage with her with the necessary formality We joined her in marriage to thee in order that in future there may be no difficulty to the Believers in the matter of marriage with the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have dissolved with the necessary formality their marriage with them And Allah´s command must be fulfilled,Wyo mao pa kaminan wyo fe gan be za nan Soko jin niima ya wyo tso ma jin niima yanan gan A egwa sun yinmino wyo mao sundan Soko wyo mae so dan yangban wyo bo yan nan Soko gau tula nan wyo mae sundan zawangizhi Soko ga ma -- yin nan wyoa sundanu nao Kaminan Zaidu bea sa jin be yinminu yin nan Yi u pa yawo ya wye Yi jin nnan jin ebou be a fe bayiba ndoci ya Muminizhi eba yawo pa be egikpaciazhi ma kaminan egi kpaciazhi ga sa bukata wo be a yin nan wuncin ma jin eyan bibicia Akika hukunci Soko eyan jin-jinci u yio
There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has indicated to him as a duty It was the practice approved of Allah amongst those of old that have passed away And the command of Allah is a decree determined,Le fi ndondo ta ti Annabi boa mini yan nan Sokoajin halali yaunaa wuncin ma ekpa yan Soko uyio dan mini za nanzhi shidzo nao alamari Soko ma kadara uyio nan gaa fe nan
It is the practice of those who preach the Messages of Allah and fear Him and fear none but Allah And enough is Allah to call men to account,Za nanzhi e wu yan egan Soko nan a mae sundan u ke dansun zandoci lugwa nan akika Sokoa kunke yaa eba egagbao
Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets and Allah has full knowledge of all things,Annabi Muhammadu fe nda ya zaeni ndondo mini bagi-ezhi boa ammade u yi Tuci Soko be emigun yan Annabizhiy Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yandondoe
O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah and do this often,Ya ye nanzhi a imani jin nan e fe tun Soko ye yetun nan dokun nan
And glorify Him morning and evening,Ye mae fe liu tsa-tsayin to lazhin to lozun
 He it is Who sends blessings on you as do His angels that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness into Light and He is Full of Mercy to the Believers,Soko ga yi Etsu nae gun ye ye ganni be malaikauzhiy nao ebo u la ye yiu wau dzun dagan bazhikozhio da haske akika ma Soko Etsu yegun U yio ya Muminizhi
Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be Peace! and He has prepared for them a generous Reward,Emisaazhi fo nan a ga gun be Sokoe nan Ugayi salamu alaikum emisa aminci U ma kezhea shiri jin kaa yan lada nan wancin nan
O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness a Bearer of Glad Tidings and Warner-,Ya wyoe Annabi! Akika Yi tun wyo tuno ebo wyo lao fe eri be za nan e ya labari yangbanfa ya Muminizhi nan be za nan e nan kafirizhi wun nan
And as one who invites to Allah´s grace by His leave and as a lamp spreading light,Wyo maafe za nan e yi zazhi lo eko Soko be izini yan Sokoe nan ganni be fitila nan e ya haske nan
 Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers that they shall have from Allah a very great Bounty,Wyo mao ya Muminizhi labari yangban-fa ke falala nan wancin nan a jin tabbata yaa dan nko yan Soko-na
 And obey not the behests of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites and heed not their annoyances but put thy Trust in Allah For enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs,Wyo mao ga lamitu kafirizhi to munafikizhi ma Wyo mao dzungan egunazhio Wyo mao lao yaokpe Soko Soko maakunke nanaya kpeu nan
O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women and then divorce them before ye have touched them no period of ´Iddat have ye to count in respect of them so give them a present And set them free in a handsome manner,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan!

O Prophet!

O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet´s houses- until leave is given you- for a meal and then not so early as to wait for its preparation but when ye are invited enter and when ye have taken your meal disperse without seeking familiar talk Such behaviour annoys the Prophet he is ashamed to dismiss you but Allah is not ashamed to tell you the truth And when ye ask his ladies for anything ye want ask them from before a screen that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah´s Messenger or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time Truly such a thing is in Allah´s sight an enormity,Ya ye nanzhi a imani jin nan!

The Unbelievers say Never to us will come the Hour Say Nay! but most surely by my Lord it will come upon you- by Him Who knows the unseen- from Whom is not hidden the least little atom in the heavens or on earth Nor is there anything less than that or greater but is in the Record Perspicuous,Za nanzhi ajin kafirinci be Sokoe nan gan Alkiyami a be ya-ayaa Gan ya gan Aa Mi zhi kuti be Tsoci mi yin wuna dabe baa Soko ga ma wun kpikpe yan na so nao yandondo fanu gwa woa ka wun a yi gwargwado zarrao dan mini sanmazhio ko kinbo ka u ga gbagba gan zarra ko ma u wan cin ganu sai dai u ga fe dan mini litafi nantso a tu la nan

 And to Solomon We made the Wind obedient Its early morning stride was a month´s journey and its evening stride was a month´s journey and We made a Font of molten brass to flow for him and there were Jinns that worked in front of him by the leave of his Lord and if any of them turned aside from our command We made him taste of the Penalty of the Blazing Fire,Yi ma efe jin foro ya Sulaimanu ezan dau yan lazhin yi yan etswa nini ezandau yan lozun yi yan etswa nini Yi ma ke je eye nuwan yan brass azarfa be yau Mini aljannuzhio ma ade nanzhi e lotun yau be izini yan Tsoci u yin nan ndondo nan ga gbotika ke umurniu lugwa nan Yi a jinu azaba be enan sairuy

 One Day He will gather them all together and say to the angels Was it you that these men used to worship,Fo nan Soko gaa naakin baenio nan ucia gan be Malaikazhi Ngba ye ga za nananzhie jin bauta yao

Say The Truth has arrived and Falsehood neither creates anything new nor restores anything,Gan gan Akika gaskiya da beani ganmanan ma u jin yandondo woa ganmanna ma wuna ye tula beaWuna kya daa taako-taako
 Say If I am astray I only stray to the loss of my own soul but if I receive guidance it is because of the inspiration of my Lord to me it is He Who hears all things and is ever near,Gan gan Akika mi gaa gbinka wuncin yi yan eti tacin mi mi ma gaa da gboro wuncin yi ebo wahayi nan Tsoci mie jin be ya mi nan Akika Etsu nae wo gan nan uyio Etsu tsonba
 If thou couldst but see when they will quake with terror but then there will be no escape for them and they will be seized from a position quite near,Da aci gan wyoa lea ye le kaminan edo gaa wan gi nan akika agan gwaa aci ga wan sun-gwa kpantsukuy dagan dannan nan tsoba nanU gayi kabariazhio
 And they will say We do believe now in the Truth but how could they receive Faith from a position so far off-,Aci gan Yi yaa imani jin be Alkuraniy ke ma a dada ci wo-kan yan imani dagan dannan nan a kpeya nao u gayi izheo
Seeing that they did reject Faith entirely before and that they continually cast slanders on the unseen from a position far off,A ma kafirinci jin beu yin shidzo a ci fe la gaskiya nan yi swiswoci nan ce ya dagan dan nan naa kpeya nao
And between them and their desires is placed a barrier as was done in the past with their partisans for they were indeed in suspicious disquieting doubt,Aci ga yekan laadan tsakaniabo be imani nan e jin shahawau nan kendoe a jinjin be eza iriazhi nanzhi shidzo nae akika a fe fi mini shakkao nan e laajin kelo kezhin nan 
Praise be to Allah Who created out of nothing the heavens and the earth Who made the angels messengers with wings- two or three or four pairs He adds to Creation as He pleases for Allah has power over all things,Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nan jin alitta sanmazhi to kin nan Etsu nana Malaikazhi fe Tucizhi nanzhiy yi be gwapazhiy nan Ndociazhi de guba guba to guta-guta to guni-guni U mae kezhe be yannan ga bau nan mini alita jino Akika Soko Etsu nan de iko nan uyio ta eti yandondo
 What Allah out of his Mercy doth bestow on mankind there is none can withhold what He doth withhold there is none can grant apart from Him and He is the Exalted in Power full of Wisdom,Eko ndondo nan Soko ga kpeya zawangizhi mini yegunu bo nan a de za nan kanuwo naa na ma u gaakan nan zandondo lau ya za wo baciu boa Akika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Egba uyio
O men! Call to mind the grace of Allah unto you! is there a creator other than Allah to give you sustenance from heaven or earth There is no god but He how then are ye deluded away from the Truth,Ya ye zawangizhi e fe pa niima Soko nanzhiy ta eti yebo nan Kashi ade halitta jinci ndoci baci Soko na eya ye arziki dagan sanmao to kinbo nan Akika a de yandoci nanajin bauta ya naa sai Soko Kiy be la a cie la ye pan ya ke eko lugwao
And if they reject thee so were messengers rejected before thee to Allah back for decision all affairs,A ma ga wyo yi ganmanan zunci Akika acinga agan be Tuci nanzhiy shi wyo dzo nan yino Alamari kpata ma a kezhe daa eba Soko
O men! Certainly the promise of Allah is true Let not then this present life deceive you nor let the Chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah,Ya ye zawangizhi akika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio ebo acino e ga lugwa edunfe izhe ta ye ma ye mae ga lugwa shaitan nane ta zazhi nan ta ye ma
Verily Satan is an enemy to you so treat him as an enemy He only invites his adherents that they may become Companions of the Blazing Fire,Akika shaitan makiri ye uyio ebo acino ye tsou la makiri Akika wune yi jamaa yinuzhi yi ebo a lazhe egimi nanzhi
 For those who reject Allah is a terrible Penalty but for those who believe and work righteous deeds is Forgiveness and a magnificent Reward,Za nanzhia jin kafirinci nan azaba nan tan saruyin nan a jin tabbata yaa za nanzhi maaimani jin nan acie lotun wangizhi nan gafara to lada nan wancin nan ajin tabbata yaa
Is he then to whom the evil of his conduct is made alluring so that he looks upon it as good equal to one who is rightly guided For Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills So let not thy soul go out in vainly sighing after them for Allah knows well all that they do!,Ngba za nana etun dedeu laapa nin fiu nan wuntso cie leu ye wangi nan u gaa zhe nini be za gurui Akika Soko egbin za nan ga bau nan u mae la za nan ga bau nan ke eko ebo acino ga wu rayi wye be yangban yin etiabo ma Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan etun nanzhi e lo nan
It is Allah Who sends forth the Winds so that they raise up the Clouds and We drive them to a land that is dead and revive the earth therewith after its death even so will be the Resurrection!,Soko gae tun efezhi tuno u cia jin u la sanma cie shio gancin Yi cie daugwalo ezhi nan yi tsutsuci nan Yi cie la kin dan rayi baci nan u ga tsu nan Acinga ga a nan ekunzhi kin kabaria bo
 If any do seek for glory and power- to Allah belong all glory and power To Him mount up all Words of Purity It is He Who exalts each Deed of Righteousness Those that lay Plots of Evil- for them is a Penalty terrible and the plotting of such will be void of result,Zandondo nan gae wa cin wan nan akika cinwan kpata egwa Soko bo u fio Egan wangizhi mae laagun da ebau U mae la etun wangizhi laatu za nanazhiy mae jin tanadi yan etun dedezhi nan azaba nan tan nan a jin tabbata yaa tanadiazhi kpata ma u ga jin lalace
 And Allah did create you from dust then from a sperm-drop then He made you in pairs And no female conceives or lays down her load but with His knowledge Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days nor is a part cut off from his life but is in a Decree ordained All this is easy to Allah,Soko ga jin halitta ye dagan jikannan bo gancin dagan maniy bo Ucia ye la fe bagi be ynzagiy Ynzagi ndondo a la ewana U ma magia sai be kpikpeu yin A ma de za nan a ya rayi kpalo naa ama de za nan a ga rayi ke tukun naa sai de wunayi kikaci dan litafio Akika wuncin yannan de sauki nan uyi ya Soko
Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike- the one palatable sweet and pleasant to drink and the other salt and bitter Yet from each kind of water do ye eat flesh fresh and tender and ye extract ornaments to wear and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves that ye may seek thus of the Bounty of Allah that ye may be grateful,Edu-nuwan guba a jin ninia nana nuwanu man sarauyin u ma fany fin nanan ma yi esan-esan luku lukuy Mini ndondoabo ma ye de nakan nan da nan gi bo ye mae kezhe wa eyan ninpazhi tinya bo nanzhi ye de fan nan ye mae le eya nuwanzhi ye nanzhie da edu wuncinzhi nan ebo ye wa bibe yan arziki Soko ebo ma ye fe jin yeboe ya-U
He merges Night into Day and he merges Day into Night and he has subjected the sun and the moon to his Law each one runs its course for a term appointed Such is Allah your Lord to Him belongs all Dominion And those whom ye invoke besides Him have not the least power,Wune la yeshi a lo dan mini batino U mae la batin a lo dan mini yeshio U ma igidi to etswa fozo ndondo mae dazan lo iyaka nan yi bibaci nan Etsu nanejin nnan nan u gayi Soko nan yi Tsoci ye nao Soko ga wun mulkio za nanzhi ye jin bauta ya baciu bo nan a de mulki yan gwargwado sun-sun dobinaa
 If ye invoke them they will not listen to your call and if they were to listen they cannot answer your prayer On the Day of Judgment they will reject your Partnership and none O man! can tell thee the Truth like the One Who is acquainted with all things,Ka ye gae yia e wo yiyi yezhia ka a ma ga wo a ya ye ezhe woa efo alkiyami ma a ga egwazhi wa be wiwo nan ye fe woa nan A ma de za nan a ya wyo labari dozhin Etsu kpikpe naa
O ye men! It is ye that have need of Allah but Allah is the One Free of all wants worthy of all praise,Ya ye zawangizhi ye ga yi talakazhi lo eba Soko Soko ga ma yi Etsu ba--Etsu nan zandondo e jin yebo ya nao
If He so pleased He could blot you out and bring in a New Creation,U ga bau u gae tanfi baenio u cia kezhe jin halitta worozhi be
Nor is that at all difficult for Allah,Wuncin ma jin eyan zwizwoci eba Soko boa
 Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another´s burdens if one heavily laden should call another to bear his load Not the least portion of it can be carried by the other Even though he be nearly related Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul and the destination of all is to Allah,Zando maa la kara lefi yan zandocia Za nan ma kara zunubiuzhi ga lukpin nan kau ga yi za gan a bau la re a bau yando la rea ka uga yi yegi nan tsoba nan Wyo deo feo jin gangbao ya za nanzhi gae sundan Tsocia swiswoci nan a ma kezhea Sallah kugikini nanZaeni ndondo nan ga tadzu ke shikan kafirinci lugwa nan wuncin yi ebo ti tacinu bo eba Soko tsa yia kezhe lo kpatao
The blind and the seeing are not alike,Yebonci be za nan e le ba ye nan a jin ye niaSurah  Nor are the depths of Darkness and the LightAcinga bazhikozhi be haske a jin ye nia
Nor are the chilly shade and the genial heat of the sun,Ba yeko be ba yi pae a jin ye nia
Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead Allah can make any that He wills to hear but thou canst not make those to hear who are buried in graves,Acinga za nanzhi yi be rayi nan be za nanzhia tsu nan a jin ye nia Akika Sokoe la gan-wo ya za nan ga bau nan Wyo ma wyoa la za nanzhi fi kabario nan wo gan woa
 Thou art no other than a warner,Wyo de fea sai dai gangba jinci
 Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner and there never was a people without a warner having lived among them in the past,Akika Yi tun wyo tun-tun ganni be gaskiyae ebo wyo yaa labari yangbanfa wyo mao naa wun akika mini alumma ndondo eza danbo nane naa wun nan
And if they reject thee so did their predecessors to whom came their messengers with Clear Signs Books of dark prophecies and the Book of Enlightenment,A ma ga egan wyo yi ganmana za nanzhi shiadzo nan atsoa egan Tuciazhi yi ganmanan kaminan Tuciazhi be yaa be bayanizhi be hujja yan takadazhi be Litafi nan yi be haske nan
In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith and how terrible was My rejection of them!,Gancin Mi cia za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nan wan ngba ke nangban yan etan winwan yan Soko yi nao
 Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky With it We then bring out produce of various colours And in the mountains are tracts white and red of various shades of colour and black intense in hue,Ye le yea kendoe Sokoe du ele be dagan sanmao naa Yi cia yangici sun-sunzhi laatinya be ele iri yan sun-sunzhi ma yi kakayin U ma ke jin dan mini patizhio ekohi nanzhiy yi bokun to dzuruzhiy nan atso ma yi iri kakayin ganni be ndocizhi nanzhi shizhiko sarauyin nan
 And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle are they of various colours Those truly fear Allah among His Servants who have knowledge for Allah is Exalted in Might Oft-Forgiving,To mini yan zawangizhio to dabbazhio to dabba yan emanwozhi atsozhi yi iri kakaayin acinga ayi baeni bo Akika Manzhi gbaugi gae sundan Soko mini wuzhiuzhi bo Akika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu gafara
Those who rehearse the Book of Allah establish regular Prayer and spend in Charity out of what We have provided for them secretly and openly hope for a commerce that will never fail,Akika za nanzhi egba litafi Soko nan ama sallah kugikini nan a mae wu dukiyazhi nan Yi la yaa nan fi eko wangizhio to swiswoci to gangbao nan akika za wuncinzhi e cewo nan a zunyaanan
For He will pay them their meed nay He will give them even more out of His Bounty for He is Oft-Forgiving Most Ready to appreciate service,Ebo acino Soko ga ladazhi shekpan yaa u maa kezhe bea mini falalauzhio Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yebo jin
That which We have revealed to thee of the Book is the Truth- confirming what was revealed before it for Allah is assuredly- with respect to His Servants - well acquainted and Fully Observant,Litafi nan tso Yi jin wahayi u be ya wyo nan wun ga yi gaskiyao U maa gaskiya ya be nanzhi be shiudzo nan Akika Soko yi be kpikpe u mae le yannan wuzhiuzhi danyn-ninbo nan ye
Then We have given the Book for inheritance to such of Our Servants as We have chosen but there are among them some who wrong their own souls some who follow a middle course and some who are by Allah´s leave foremost in good deeds that is the highest Grace,Ganci yi cia Litafi laa gi gun ya eza tsitsacizhi mini wuzhi yi zhio ade miniabo nanejin ti tacinu gun nan ama de nanzhi yi eza tacingizhi nan ama de nanzhi a shidzo be etu alhairizhi be yarda Sokoe nan Wuncin ga yi daraja nantso wancin nao
 Gardens of Eternity will they enter therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments there will be of silk,Wato aljannazhi nan aga jin dawwama fi nan aga ganfi bo a ci ga pa nin fi bo be gadozhi nana jin be zinariyae to aluluyinan tufuwazhi ma mini aljannao u gayi ede yan alharirio siliki
And they will say Praise be to Allah Who has removed from us all sorrow for our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving Ready to appreciate service,Aci gan Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko nana yangban-yin lakeyabo ya yi nan Akika Tsoci yi Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yebo jin
 Who has out of His Bounty settled us in a Home that will last no toil nor sense of weariness shall touch us therein,Etsu nana yi cin fi emi yan danbo dano mini falalau bo nan yia le wahala ndondo ye miniu boa yi maawo ebo ndondo miniu boa
But those who reject Allah - for them will be the Fire of Hell No term shall be determined for them so they should die nor shall its Penalty be lightened for them Thus do We reward every ungrateful one!,Za nanzhiy maa a jin kafirinci be Sokoe nan egagba yan enan jahannama wunajin tabbata yaa a ga -- rayi beayin acia tsuaa maa jin sauki yan azaba yaa Acinga ga yi e ga kafiri ndondo gbao
 Therein will they cry aloud for assistance Our Lord! Bring us out we shall work righteousness not the deeds we used to do! - Did We not give you long enough life so that he that would should receive admonition and moreover the warner came to you So taste ye the fruits of your deeds for the wrong-doers there is no helper,A ma fe yi kabara fi miniu bo aafe gan gan Ya wyo Tsoci yi!

 Verily Allah knows all the hidden things of the heavens and the earth verily He has full knowledge of all that is in men´s hearts,Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yan yannanzhi swo fi sanmazhio to kin bo nanAkika Soko yi be kpikpe yan yannanzhi swo fi yangbanzhio nan
 He it is That has made you inheritors in the earth if then any do reject Allah their rejection works against themselves their rejection but adds to the odium for the Unbelievers in the sight of their Lord their rejection but adds to their own undoing,Soko ga la ye cia fe halifazhi kpe kinbo Zaeni ndondo nan ga jin kafirinci nan egagba yan kafirincia wuyan yau Kafirinci yan kafirizhi man wuna bea yandondo eba Tsociaboa sai dai hallaka kafirinci yan kafirizhia bea yandondoa sai dai hasara
Say Have ye seen these ´Partners´ of yours whom ye call upon besides Allah Show Me what it is they have created in the wide earth Or have they a share in the heavens Or have We given them a Book from which they can derive clear evidence- Nay the wrong-doers promise each other nothing but delusions,Gan gan Ye le yea za nanzhi ye la a pa mi baci nan ye cie jin bauta yaa ke Soko lugwa nan e lawu Mi yin kiy zhiy a jin halittau kpe eti kinbo kashi a pama ganni be Sokoe eba jin-jin yan sanmao kashi yi la Litafi ndoci la yaa kayin nantso a fe hujja yaa nan U jin acina akika azwalumizhi de a de yannanzhi e la jin dozhi alkawali naa sai dai eta
 It is Allah Who sustains the heavens and the earth lest they cease to function and if they should fail there is none - not one - can sustain them thereafter Verily He is Most Forbearing Oft-Forgiving,Akika Soko ga la egwa sun sanmazhi to kin aci dua yino akika a ma ga du-du zaeni ndondo la egwa sunu wo baci Soko boa Akika Soko Etsu hakuri uyio Etsu gaafara uyio
They swore their strongest oaths by Allah that if a warner came to them they would follow his guidance better than any other of the Peoples But when a warner came to them it has only increased their flight from righteousness-,A ma zhi kuti be Sokoe iyaka yan kuti zhia zhi gan Akika gangba jinci ga be yaa a gaafe dan mini aluma nanzhi a gwo bawu gan zazhi nan kaminan gangba jinci be be yaanan u bea yandondoa sai de kpikpe-yai be bawuy
On account of their arrogance in the land and their plotting of Evil but the plotting of Evil will hem in only the authors thereof Now are they but looking for the way the ancients were dealt with But no change wilt thou find in Allah´s way of dealing no turning off wilt thou find in Allah´s way of dealing,Ebo eti kagbo ta eti kinbo be makirinci dede U mae cin ta eti zando boa sai eti za nane jinu nan Eza nan-nanzhiy atu yandondo yea sai de ekpa yan egagba iri yan za mafarizhi Wyo maatsun egbazhe dan ekpa Soko boa wyo matsun egwa-san dan mini ekpa Soko boa
Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them- though they were superior to them in strength Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth for He is All-Knowing All-Powerful,Kashi! E za-za kpe eti kinboa acia cinale a lo kendoe zoba yan zanazhi shiadzo nan yi-yi naa a maafe gan a gboka gana yandondo ma gan Soko gwaa dan mini sanmazhio ko kin boa Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu iko
If Allah were to punish men according to what they deserve He would not leave on the back of the earth a single living creature but He gives them respite for a stated Term when their Term expires verily Allah has in His sight all His Servants,Da agan Soko e din-ye-din wan zazhi be lefiazhi da a de rayi ndondo ke ta eti kin boa amaade wyune pata yaa da lokaci nan yi be iyakae nan Kaminan iyakazhi gaatun nan akika Soko Etsu uyio nane cin wuzhiuzhi le nan 
 Ya Sin,YASIN Bayanizhi shidzo etiu boani
By the Qur´an full of Wisdom,Mie zhi kuti be Alkuranuy nanashe be hikimae nan
 Thou art indeed one of the messengers,Akika Wyoe Muhammadu wyo dan mini TucizhioSurah On a Straight WayWyo ta eti ekpa nantso yi gboro nanSurah It is a Revelation sent down by Him the Exalted in Might Most MercifulAlkuranu ma u cin cin be dagan eba Soko nan yi Etsu zankpe nan Etsu yegun
In order that thou mayest admonish a people whose fathers had received no admonition and who therefore remain heedless of the Signs of Allah,Ebo wyo jin gangbao ya jamaa nanzhi a jin gangba ya yanmanciazhia nan a cia fe dan eyeyaona
The Word is proved true against the greater part of them for they do not believe,Akika hukunci Soko azaba a jin tabbata eti kundondoa bo ebo nan ya gaskiyaa na
We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins so that their heads are forced up and they cannot see,Akika Yia kuruzhi ku fia kpatsunazhio har da daa wan nungbeazhi ebo acino etiazhi a kan ta fitio
 And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them and further We have covered them up so that they cannot see,Yi cia yekan laa dan yegboroa bo yekan madan to zunmaabo Yi cia eyan la arukpea aci le ba ye bea
 The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them they will not believe,Yeni mau yi ebaabo ko wyo jina gangba ko ma wyo ga jina ma ajin za nanzhi a ya gaskiya naa
 Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the Lord Most Gracious unseen give such a one therefore good tidings of Forgiveness and a Reward most generous,Akika wyoe jin gangba jin ya za nan gae la mitu foro Alkurani nan u mae kezhe sundan Soko swiswociy nan Annabi yau labari yangban fa be gafara yan Sokoe to lada nan wancin nan
Verily We shall give life to the dead and We record that which they send before and that which they leave behind and of all things have We taken account in a clear Book of evidence,Akika Yi gaela rayi dan eyan tsutsucizhio Yi ma ga etun nan zhi a la shidzo nan ka to ekpa nanzhiy a da nan Yandondo ma Yiu jin lisafi dan mini litafi nan wancin uma yi gbangba na
Set forth to them by way of a parable the story of the Companions of the City Behold! there came messengers to it,Wyo mao la misalio wua yan jamaa yan alkarya ndoci ka mi nan Tucizhi be yaa na
 When We first sent to them two messengers they rejected them But We strengthened them with a third they said Truly we have been sent on a mission to you,Ka mi nan Yi tun Tuci guba fia nan a cia eganazhi yi gasmanan Yi cia be kagbo be za taciy a ci gan Akika yi de Tucizhi yiyi be ebayeyeo
 The people said Ye are only men like ourselves and Allah Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation ye do nothing but lie,A ci gan ye yi zandoa sai dai zawangi dozhin yiSoko ALRAHMANU ma cin yanndondo bea ye de ganmanan tsaba u ga ye zuno
They said Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you,A ci gan Tsociyi u yi be kpikpe ke de Tucizhi yiyi be eba ye yeo nao
And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message,Etunndo ma ta eti yi boa sai dai yanwu nan yi be bayaniy nan
 The people said for us we augur an evil omen from you if ye desist not we will certainly stone you And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us,A ci gan Yi ye cinye le eza de dezhi kagan ma ye lugwaa yi gae ce yan ye ma gagun be azaba nan tannan dagan eba yi bo
 They said Your evil omens are with yourselves deem ye this an evil omen If ye are admonished Nay but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!,A ci gan cincinle yan eyan dedeyezhi u dan ganni be ye tsoe kashi ebo tukpa nan a paye nan u ga la ye ci gan acino Aa ye de fea saidaiza nanzhie nyin yanzhi nan
Then there came running from the farthest part of the City a man saying O my people! Obey the messengers,Eza bagi ndoci ci be dagan efu nanlokpa gan mini ezhio nao u fe dinye u ci gan Ya ye jamaazhi ya emi tu Tucizhi
 Obey those who ask no reward of you for themselves and who have themselves received Guidance,Yea emi tu za nazhi e gbin ye gan yan lada etunazhi a nana ma kezhe yi eza eko gboro nan eza bawuzhi nan
 It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me and to Whom ye shall all be brought back,Kiyma a kan mi cia jin bawta ya Etsu nanjin alita mi yina naa yino ezhekeba ye kpata ma u dan eba u bo
Shall I take other gods besides Him If Allah Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me of no use whatever will be their intercession for me nor can they deliver me,Ngba mi ga zandoci baci Soko la gan wyun gayi ndakatao Ngan Soko ALRAHMANU wuna kpa mimacinle ndoci be mi yin gwatan yan zandodoa wuna jin mi amfania a ma bo mi yawoa
I would indeed if I were to do so be in manifest Error,Akika mi ga jin acin mi gafe dan mini egbino nantso a tu la na
 For me I have faith in the Lord of you all listen then to me!,Akika mia imanijin ganni be Tsoci ye yin ye mae laefe erie ya mi
It was said Enter thou the Garden He said Ah me! Would that my People knew what I know!,Aci ganu gan A gandan Aljannao U gan kasa! daaci gan jamaa yan mizhi de kpikpe yan alhairi na Soko jin ya mi nan
 For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour!,To fifa nan u fa be mi yin nae U ci kezhea mi laadan ezacinwancizhio
And We sent not down against his People after him any hosts from heaven nor was it needful for Us so to do,Yi ma cin ekungunci ndondo be ya jamaa yanu zhi zunmau boa Yi ma cin be lea
It was no more than a single mighty Blast and behold! they were like ashes quenched and silent,Alamaria u fea sai dai kabara nini kpata cia fe eza tsutsucizhi
 Ah! Alas for My Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him!,Egiti yan robonkpe wunajin tabbata ta eti wuzhizhio kamindondo nan tuci gabe yaanan aa fe za nazhi e lau mi nan
 See they not how many generations before them we destroyed Not to them will they return,Kashi a le ba yelea ekun dondo za nanzhi Yi jina hallaka shia dzo mini alummazhio na akika Za wuncinzhi a kezhe zhin ebaa bea
 But each one of them allwill be brought before Us for judgment,Akika ma kpata a gaa ku ye kanbe zhi yegboro Yi bo
A Sign for them is the earth that is dead We do give it life and produce grain therefrom of which ye do eat,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko yaa Kin naa tsu nan yiu dan rayi yi cia yangici sunsunzhi laatin yardagan miniu bo U cia fe yangici nanzhi e gi nan
And We produce therein orchard with datepalms and vines and We cause springs to gush forth therein,Yi cikezhea lati yan dobinazhi jin dan ninyinu bo to yangici inabizhi Yi ci kezhea eye nuwanzhi laatinya fi miniu bo
That they may enjoy the fruits of this artistry It was not their hands that made this will they not then give thanks,Ebo a fea deagi dagan yangici sunsunuzhio to nazhi a tso ga la egwazhi ci lotunu nan Ngba zannazhia jin yebo ya Sokoa
 Glory to Allah Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces as well as their own human kind and other things of which they have no knowledge,Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu naa alittazhi kpata jin eba be yiwoe nan Dagan mini yannanzhi yin tinya kinbo na to mini atso Zawangizhio to yannazhi a de kpikpe wuna nan
And a Sign for them is the Night We withdraw therefrom the Day and behold they are plunged in darkness,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko yeshi na Yia jin yi wa ebatin tinya dagan miniu bo na alittazhi ci gaa fe dan mini bazhiko
And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him that is the decree of Him the Exalted in Might the AllKnowing,To igidiotso wunajin u fe bi ci da iyaka yan ecinbau Nannan shiri u yio yan Soko na yi Etsu zankpe nan an yi Etsu kpikpe nan
 And the Moon We have measured for her mansions to traverse till she returns like the old and withered lower part of a datestalk,To etswao tso yia ecinbazhi tswa cigban dobina gbako na
It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon nor can the Night outstrip the Day Each just swims along in its own orbit according to Law,Wuna ye jin ya igidi nan wuna tso etswa naa yeshi maashi batin dzoa ndondoa ma gun mini falakio a cie je za
 And a Sign for them is that We bore their race through the Flood in the loaded Ark,U ma dan mini egwa wu yan zankpe Soko yaa yia zuriyaazhi ku fi mini eyao nan yi shisheci nan
 And We have created for them similar vessels on which they ride,Yi ma kejin inu zhi yaa nan a fe de tu nan
 If it were Our Will We could drown them then would there be no helper to hear their cry nor could they be delivered,U ma ga ba yi yi gaajin hallaka fi mini edwo a maa de za nanajina taimako naa a ma ade zanana woa tinya naa
Except by way of Mercy from Us and by way of world convenience to serve them for a time,Sai de yegan dagan eba yi bo be emawo yan etapa daaeka ndoci
 When they are told Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you in order that ye may receive Mercy they turn back,A ma ga gan yagan e sundan yan alamari na ci ye gboroe bo na to nan tso dan zunmae bo nan beacin ma Sokoa gune ye
Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord but they turn away therefrom,A ya ndondo na ga be ya dangan mini aya yan Soko zhio na ajin a zunma zhe ta
A ya ndondo na ga be ya dangan mini aya yan Soko zhio na ajin a zunma zhe ta,
And when they are told Spend ye of the bounties with which Allah has provided you the Unbelievers say to those who believe Shall we then feed those whom if Allah had so willed He would have fed Himself Ye are in nothing but manifest error,A ma ga gan yaagan efe wu dukiya yezhi mini nanzhi Soko la arzikiu ya ye nan fi eko guruo Za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nana gan be za tsaabe la yangici ya za nan u ga be Soko gan wuna yaugi u gaayau gi nao Akika eza iri nazhi a fea sai de dan mini egbin nana tulanao
Further they say When will this promise come to pass if what ye say is true,A majin a fe gan gan Fo ci alkawali yan alkiyami a yio wunayi gaskiya tsa ye tao nao
They will not have to wait for aught but a single Blast it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves!,Yando danbo nan e tu ye naa sai de kabara ninikete Nan a dzun dzun fia lokaci nan mini ekoce yan eyan wa yan izeo nao
No chance will they then have by will to dispose of their affairs nor to return to their own people!Kanga ade iko yan wasiyya jina a maade ezhe ke lo eba iyaliazhi bea,
The trumpet shall be sounded when behold! from the sepulchres men will rush forth to their Lord!,Aci ga kafo be gancin a cia fe gu tinya dagan kabarizhio a cia fe lo eba Tsocia
They will say Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose A voice will say This is what Allah Most Gracious had promised And true was the word of the messengers!,A cia gan gan Kasaayi re! zae yi za na nanyikin dagan elele ba yi bo nao A cia yaezhe gan Ngan nannan ga yi yannan Soko Etsu yegun fe la jin yi alkawali nao Tucizhi ma a gaskiya ta
 It will be no more than a single Blast when lo! they will all be brought up before Us!,Akika alamari nannan ufea sai de kabara nini ke gancin kpata ci gaa gun yekan zhi yagboro Yi bo
Then on that Day not a soul will be wronged in the least and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds,Yinnan nnan aajin rayi ndondo egun ndondoa a maa gae gbaa sai de be iri etun nanzhi ye fe lo izheonan
 Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do,Akika za mi Aljannazhi yinnan afedan mini shagalio a maa fe wo man
They and their associates will be in groves of cool shade reclining on Thrones of dignity,To a to yinmiazhi a gaakpetso ta eti gadokozhio fi mini wuru aljannazhio
 Every fruit enjoyment will be there for them they shall have whatever they call for,A ma yi be yangici marimarizhi fi nini yanu bo a ma yibe yan dondo nan a gae wa nan

 And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day!,Ye mae laekpe kayin yinna ya ye lefi jinci zhi
Did I not enjoin on you O ye Children of Adam that ye should not worship Satan for that he was to you an enemy avowed,A sa mi jin ye gangbaa ya ye egi Adamazhi kede ye ga jin bauta ya shaitan maa Akika makiu ye u yio yan gbangba
 And that ye should worship Me for that this was the Straight Way,Ye mae fe jin bautae ya Mi nannan ga yi ekpa nantso yi gboro nao
 But he did lead astray a great multitude of you Did ye not then understand, Akika ma shaitan wuna jamaa nanzhi dokun nan gbin kiy la ye ci gaa fe eza ankalizhia yino
This is the Hell of which ye were repeatedly warned!,Nannan ga yi enan jahannama nan tso ajin ye alkawali nao
 Embrace ye the fire this Day for that ye persistently rejected Truth,Yea gan fi bo yinnannnan ebo etun kafirinci nanzhiy ye lo naa
That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths But their hands will speak to us and their feet bear witness to all that they did,Yinnannnan Yi ga misunazhi te egwaazhi cia gangan be Yi yin bicia zhi maajin ri etun nanzhi a fe lo nan
If it had been our Will We could surely have blotted out their eyes then should they have run about groping for the Path but how could they have seen,U ma ga ba Yi Yiga eyeazhi fin ya a cia fe sanganna be eciy ta eti kpandara swiratio kea dada ci le ba ye nao
And if it had been Our Will We could have transformed them to remain in their places then should they have been unable to move about nor could they have returned after error,U ga ba Yi Yi gafin ya ba nanzhi a kpe nao acia de ba lo yegboroa amaa zhin zunma woa
 If We grant long life to any We cause him to be reversed in nature Will they not then understand,Za nan ma yi ga yau rayi kpalo nan yi ga halittau zhegba daake yan dzakanbo nan kashi a de ankali dea
 We have not instructed the Prophet in Poetry nor is it meet for him this is no less than a Message and a Qur´an making things clear,Yi ma la eniko wu Annabi Muhammadua U mayin ya wuna yan nan ube beyin nan U fea sai de sinsantu ganni be Alkuranu nana tula nan
That it may give admonition to any who are alive and that the charge may be proved against those who reject Truth,Ebo ujin gangbau ya za nan ga yi be rayiy nan  uga yi Muminio azaba ma gajin tabbata ta eti kafirizhio
 See they not that it is We Who have created for themamong the things which Our hands have fashionedcattle which are under their dominion,Kashi! A le ye kendoe Yi jin halitta yan dabba emawozhi jin yaa be egwa Yi yin naa Acia fe yan nanzhi e jin mulkia naa

And that We have subjected them to their use of them some do carry them and some they eat,Yi cia jin foro yaa ebo anfaniabo acie de yana tu za a mae kezhe de gigi dagan miniubo
 And they have other profits from them besides and they get milk to drink Will they not then be grateful,A mae de eyan anfani miniabo to eyan finfincizhi Ngba aajin yebo ya sokoa
 And they have other profits from them besides and they get milk to drink Will they not then be grateful,A mae de eyan anfani miniabo to eyan finfincizhi Ngba aajin yebo ya sokoa
 Yet they take for worship gods other than Allah hoping that they might be helped!,Acie da wun kuti ndocizhi ke Soko lugwa ebo kutizhia jina taimako
They have not the power to help them but they will be brought up before Our Judgmentseat as a troop to be condemned,Kutizhi ma jina taimako ndondo woa atso kafirizhi tsa yi kagbo nan zhie tswa kutizhi nao
 Let not their speech then grieve thee Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose,Ga lugwa eganazhi yin wyo yangban ma akika Yi de kpikpe yan nanzhie so nan to nanzhi a la tula nan
 Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm yet behold! he stands forth as an open adversary!,Zawangi leye lea ke de Yi ga jin halittau dagan maniy bo naa U ci kezhe beazhe za nane sunwun cie gbomi be alamari Sokoe nan
 And he makes comparisons for Us and forgets his own origin and Creation He says Who can give life to dry bones and decomposed ones at that,Har u gan wine la egan wu yi be misali jiny ucia to kendoe Soko jin halittau jin nan batan Uci gan Ngba ziy dan tsukun rayi wo beo kaminan u ga ban cia gi ya zo nao
 Say He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He is Wellversed in every kind of creation!,Gan gan Etsu wuncin nan la rayi yau cabae nan u danu rayi wo be Akika Etsu uyio nan de kpikpe yan jinjin halitta irindondo nan
 The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree when behold! ye kindle therewith your own fires!,Etsu naa enan jin ya ye dagan mini cigban funfuruo nan ye cie de enan gun beu yinna

 Verily when He intends a thing His Command is be and it is!,Akika ma alamari Soko kandondo nan eyan ga bau yin jin nan wunajin u ganu gan a fe uci ga fe kendoe ugae bau nan
Sad By the Qur´an Full of Admonition This is the TruthSWAD ,Soko gan Mi zhikuti be Alkuranuy nan yi eyan cinwanci nan
But the Unbelievers are steeped in self-glory and Separatism,Akika za nanzhi a jin kafirinci nan aafe dan mini eti kagbo be emigboe
How many generations before them did We destroy In the end they cried for mercy- when there was no longer time for being saved!,Alummazhi nanzhiy dokun nan Yiajin hallaka shiadzo bedzo a ci wa egwa gan lokaci nan egwagan wa wuna jina anfania nan
So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! and the Unbelievers say This is a sorcerer telling lies!,Acia jin mamaki nan gangba jinci fe be yaa dagan mini atso nan kafirizhi ci gan Za nnan de eyan manci uyio u ma yi ganmanan zunci
So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! and the Unbelievers say This is a sorcerer telling lies!,Acia jin mamaki nan gangba jinci fe be yaa dagan mini atso nan kafirizhi ci gan Za nnan de eyan manci uyio u ma yi ganmanan zunci

Has he made the gods all into one Allah Truly this is a wonderful thing!,Ke-a ta ta uci ga Sokozhi laazhe Soko nini nao Akika nanan eyan mamaki uyio
And the leader among them go away impatiently saying Walk ye away and remain constant to your gods! For this is truly a thing designed against you!,Nunsa yan kinzhi cia nankin a ci fe gan gan e fe lo yane ye mae la hakuri e jin ta eti bauta kutiezhio Akika nanan shiri uyio nan a kpa nan a kpkpa gan a la yi yaagan be kuti yizhiy
We never heard the like of this among the people of these latter days this is nothing but a made-up tale!,Yi laawo iri nnan lea dan mini adini nanzhiy shidzo nanboa nanan tsoma u iy yandondoa sai de ganmanan nan atswa nan
 What! has the Message been sent to him - Of all persons among usbut they are in doubt concerning My Own Message! Nay they have not yet tasted My Punishment!,Ngba tacin yi nanzhiy zhi daanan ga bo a cin Alkuranu be ya wuno Aa ade jin kelo kezhin jin eti Alkuranuo Wuncin ma yi ebo nan ala fin azaba Mi yina nao
Or have they the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord- the Exalted in Power the Grantor of Bounties without measure,Kashi eba a ga bo edzunbako yan arziki yan yegun Tsoci wye nan yi Etsu zankpe Etsu rytwa nan dano
Or have they the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all between If so let them mount up with the ropes and means to reach that end!,Kashi a ga wun mulki yan sanmazhio to kin to yan nanzhi fi tacinabo nao Wunayi acino a fea gunakpe ekpzhio yandondo nan agae wa nan u ciu lau yeu de
But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates,Akika a de jamaa eti kperezhi nan zhiy shidzo nan kpata ma Soko a tan fi
Before them were many who rejected messengers- the people of Noah and ´Ad and Pharaoh the Lord of Stakes,Jamaa yan Nuhu zhi uuyi ganmanan shidzo be dzo to Aduzhi to Firauna nan yi be kangarizhiy nan
And Thamud and the people of Lut and the Companions of the Wood - such were the Confederates,To samuduzhi to jamaa yan Lutu to jamaa yan Aikatazhi a ga yi jamaa yan Annabi Shuaibuo a gayi jamaa wuncinzhi nanzhiy Ye gan gana nao
Not one of them but rejected the messengers but My punishment came justly and inevitably on them,Ndondoa a Tucizhi yi ganmanan azaba cia jin tabbata ta etiabo
These today only wait for a single mighty Blast which when it comes will brook no delay,Zan nanazhiy ma ade yannan e tuye naa sai de kabara nini kete nan ndoci dan yegboro u boa nan
They say Our Lord! hasten to us our sentence even before the Day of Account!,Aci gan Tsoci yi a rabo yan azaba yi laa ya yi vaa yin tun kafi efo egagbae nan
Have patience at what they say and remember our servant David the man of strength for he ever turned to Allah,A hakuri eti iri egan nanzhiye e gan nan Wyo mao pa wuzhi yi Dawuda nan gboka nan akika eza uyio na ezhe keba alamari u kpata wuna ku ya Soko nan
 It was We that made the hills declare in unison with him Our Praises at eventide and at break of day,Akika Yia patizhi jin foro yau aajin afe -- mi tasbihi jin ya Soko to yeshi to Lazhin
And the birds gathered in assemblies all with him did turn to Allah,To elugizhi nanzhi a kuyekan nan kpata ma afe ela mi tu forouzhi
We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech and decision,Yi maamulkiu gboka yi ma twaurya be hikimae ganni be kpikpe yan hukunci bae tsakani za nazhi gae sunwun nan
Has the Story of the Disputants reached thee Behold they climbed over the wall of the private chamber,Ngba labari yan za nazhiy sunwun-na be eba wyo yaani Ka mi na a gun lo masallacinan
 When they entered the presence of David and he was terrified of them they said Fear not we are two disputants one of whom has wronged the other Decide now between us with truth and treat us not with injustice but guide us to the even Path,Kami na a gandan eba Dawudao na dansuna cia wanu aci gan Ga sundan ma yiza guba nanan yie sunwun-sun zaenia za ba ci jin gun ebo acino a hukunci ba tsakani yibo be gaskiyae Wyo tso mao ga jin zwalunci ma mao wu yi ba yan eko gboro
This man is my brother He has nine and ninety ewes and I have but one Yet he says ´commit her to my care´ and is moreover harsh to me in speech,Akika za nnan yegi mi yio u yi be nangizhi har shitsun din nini mima de nangi ninikete uci ganUu la ya mi-nkpa u ma mi kutso be egan wunciny
David said He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy single ewe to be added to his flock of ewes truly many are the partners in business who wrong each other Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness and how few are theyand David gathered that We had tried him he asked forgiveness of his Lord fell down bowing in prostration and turned to Allah in repentance,Dawuda ci gan Akika wuna wuna wyo jin gun na u gan wyo la nangi wyo yo be yan wun zhi na akika ekun dondo yan za nan zhie la dukiyazhi keba eti wo ceo nan e jin dozhi zwalunci jin sai de za nanzhiy ga imani jin acie lotun guru na eza degi ma u ga iri za wuncinzhi yio Kanga gancin Dawuda otso akpe ke yiu ma cin le nan u ci wa gafara yan Tsociu u ci nikin cici u ci fe jin ruku u cia alamariuzhi kpata laaya Soko
So We forgave him this lapse he enjoyed indeed a Near Approach to Us and a beautiful place of Final Return,Yi cia fa beu yin be wun ciny Akika ma u de tsonba Yi u ma de ezhe keba wangi
O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth so judge thou between men in truth and justice Nor follow thou the lusts of thy heart for they will mislead thee from the Path of Allah for those who wander astray from the Path of Allah is a Penalty Grievous for that they forget the Day of Account,Ya wyoe Dawuda akika Yia wyo laafe halifa ta eti kin bo acino fe jin hukunci tsakani zazhio be gaskiyae ga kara lami tu etun yangban ma kacina uga wyo gbin ke eko Soko lugwa nan egagba yan azaba na gboka na ga ajin tabbata yaa ebo efo egagba nan a batan nan
Not without purpose did We create heaven and earth and all between! that were the thought of Unbelievers! but woe to the Unbelievers because of the Fire of Hell!,Yi ma jin sanma to kin to kin to yan nanzhi fi tacinabo nan eti kperea wuncin ga yi yekpa yan kafirinzhio azaba yan enan wunaji tabbata ya kafirizhi
 Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness the same as those who do mischief on earth Shall We treat those who guard against evil the same as those who turn aside from the right,Kashi Yi ga za nanzhi a imani jin acie lotun nan laazhe kpe eti kinbo nan Kashi yi ga za na zhie tswa Soko nan laazhe ye ni be eza banzazhiy
Here is a Book which We have sent down unto thee full of blessings that they may mediate on its Signs and that men of understanding may receive admonition,Litafi u yio na yi be albarkae nan Yi cinu cin be ya wye ebo a fea kpaye eti a yauzhio u mau laufe sinsantun u ya zanazhi yi be hankaliy nan
 To David We gave Solomon for a son- How excellent in Our service! Ever did he turn to Us!,Yi ma la ryatwa yan egi Sulaimanu ya Dawuda Madalla be wuzhi nanae lo eba Sokonan
Behold there were brought before him at eventide coursers of the highest breeding and swift of foot,Ka-mi na a ta dabbazhi zhi safuo yau aci gi gbaro be lozuny nan
 And he said Truly do I love the love of good with a view to the glory of my Lord- until the sun was hidden in the veil of night,U ci gan Akika mi wa gan min lo etun alheri ndoci u cia tamba ce ta mi ke sallah Laasar lugwa har sai nan igidia swo dan yekanubo nan
Bring them back to me then began he to pass his hand over their legs and their necks,Uci gan E kuazhin be tsun mi u ci fe kaa yan be ebiy biciazhio to koroazhio
And We did try Solomon We placed on his throne a body without life but he did turn to Us in true devotion,Akika Yia Sulaimanu mancin le Yi cia nankan kpace ndoci yan eza tsutsuci ceta eti esaubo Uci kezhe da ba Soko be jin-jin ibadae
He said O my Lord! Forgive me and grant me a kingdom which it may be suits not another after me for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties without measure,U ci gan Tsoci fa be mi yin Wyo mao twami rya be mulki nan Zandondoade iriu zunma mi boa nan Akika Wyo ga yi Etsu ryatwao
Then We subjected the wind to his power to flow gently to his order Whithersoever he willed-,Yi cia efe jin foro yau u cie dazan be umurniu yin karayin lo bandondo nan uga eye wu nan
 As also the evil ones including every kind of builder and diver-,To shaitanzhi nanzhie tu eba iri ndondo nan zhi e gbin nuwan nan
 As also others bound together in fetters,To ndocizhi a pa fi mini kuruzhio
 Such are Our Bounties whether thou bestow them on others or withhold them no account will be asked,Nan na kpata eryatwa yi uyio nan de lisafia nan Wuna bao wyo tso la twarya ko ma wyo a yano sun gwa
 And he enjoyed indeed a Near Approach to Us and a beautiful Place of Final ReturnAkika ma u de tsonba yi ganni be ezhe keba wangiy,
Commemorate Our Servant Job Behold he cried to his Lord The Evil One has afflicted me with distress and suffering!,Wyo mao pa wuzhi yi Ayuba Kami na u fe yi Tsociu ye nan u ci gan A kika shaitan yana egwa la two mi gan ni be etane
The command was given Strike with thy foot here is water wherein to wash cool and refreshing and water to drink,Aci ganu gan A kin gba be bici o yin Nuwan yeko nan ga tin-ya bo nan uu fu wyo mao fe o finu
 And We gave him back his people and doubled their number- as a Grace from Ourselves and a thing for commemoration for all who have Understanding,Yici twaurya be iyaliuzhiy be ndocizhi ganni bea yin Yegun u yio dagan eba Yi bo u ma yi sinsan tu ya za nanzhiy ga de han-kali nan

And commemorate Our Servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob possessors of Power and Vision,Wyo ma o pa wuzhi Yi Ibrahima to Ishaka to Yakubu Za nanzhiy gboka nan a yio a ma yi eza hankalizhi
Verily We did choose them for a special purpose- proclaiming the Message of the Hereafter,Akika Yia tadzu be edzuta yan pipa yan efo zobae
 They were in Our sight truly of the company of the Elect and the Good,Akika ma eba yi bo a dan mini eza tsitsaci zhio a ma yi eza alhairi zhi
 And commemorate Isma´il Elisha and Zul-Kifl Each of them was of the Company of the Good,Wyo mao kezheo pa Ismaila to Alyasau to Zulkiflu kpataa dan mini eza alhairi zhio
This is a Message of admonition and verily for the righteous is a beautiful Place of Final Return-,Nan na yetun wangizhi a yio akika ma za nazhie tswa Soko nan a yi be zoba wangiy
 Gardens of Eternity whose doors will ever be open to them,U ga yi Aljannazhi nan a fi tutunyin nan ekozhi kpata ma yi kpikpeci ebo a bo

They will say Our Lord! whoever brought this upon us- Add to him a double Penalty in the Fire!,Acia gan gan Tsoci yi Zandondo nan ga degwa dan egagba dede nan-nao nan beu azaba sarauyin dan mini enao
 And they will say What has happened to us that we see not men whom we used to number among the bad ones,Aci ke gan kiy la yi ci laa le bagi ndocizhi yea yino Ebo nan kami na yidan izheo nan yi fe leaye le ke eza dedezhi nan
Did we treat them as such in ridicule or have our eyes failed to perceive them,Kashi yi fe laami laa Kashi eye yizhi tsa pan yao yi ci lea yea yino
Truly that is just and fitting- the mutual recriminations of the People of the Fire!,Akika ewun-sun nan nan tsakani egimi nanzhio gaskiya uyio

 Say That is a Message Supreme above all-,Gan gan Wuncin labari uyio nan wancin nan

Surah  No knowledge have I of the Chiefs on high when they discuss matters among themselves,Mide kpikpe ndondo eti malaika wancikozhi boa kami nan e gan gan elo bezhin be Tsociy naa
´Only this has been revealed to me that I am to give warning plainly and publicly,Umajin wahayi ndoci e jin be ya mi yina sai de mi de yi za naejin gangba naatula nan
Behold thy Lord said to the angels ,I am about to create man from clayKami nan Tsoci wye gan be malaikazhiy gan Akika Mie wa gan miajin alitta yan zawangi be eguny
When I have fashioned him in due proportion and breathed into him of My spirit fall ye down in obeisance unto him,Kami nan Mi gau jin gunmi nan Micia efe yan ruhi Mi be fiu nan kpatae yaa ya zhi kinbo ye jin sujadae yau
 So the angels prostrated themselves all of them together,Malaikazhi kpata cida sujada yau
Not so Iblis he was haughty and became one of those who reject Faith,Sai de Iblisu nana gbotika nan ucia fe dan mini kafiri zhio
Allah said O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands Art thou haughty Or art thou one of the high and mighty ones,Soko cigan Kiy kan wye sujada jin ya alitta nan Mi jin be egwa Mi yin nao Wyo gbotika gbo kashi wyoa fe dan mini za nanzhie wo tia san nao
 Iblis said I am better than he thou createdst me from fire and him thou createdst from clay,Uci gan Ngan mi ganu ebo nan ena wyoajin mi yino egun ma wyoa jin wun yino
Allah said Then get thee out from here for thou art rejected accursed,Soko cigan adzun tinya dagan mini Aljannao akika wyoa fe eza cice yaci
And My curse shall be on thee till the Day of Judgment,Laana Mi ma ta etiobo har da fo nan aga alkiyami nan-na
Iblis said O my Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the dead are raisedUci gan Tsoci pata ya mi har da fo nan agaa naakin nan,
Allah said Respite then is granted thee-,Soko ci gan Akika wyo dan mini za nan mia pata ya nan
Till the Day of the Time Appointed,Har da efo yan lokaci nan yi be iyakae nan
 Till the Day of the Time Appointed,Har da efo yan lokaci nan yi be iyakae nan
 Iblis said Then by Thy power I will put them all in the wrong-,Uci gan Mi zhi kuti be zankpeo yin akika mi gaa gbin bae nio
Except Thy Servants amongst them sincere and purified by Thy Grace,Sai de wuzhi wyozhi nanzhiy wyo ga yangbanazhi tadzu nan
Allah said Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting-,Soko gan Akika yan gaskiya be gaskiya tsabae u ga Mie gan ya ye yeo
That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee- every one,WALLAHI Mi ga jahannama she pin yin be wyo yin to za nanzhi ga emi tuo nan-baenio
Say No reward do I ask of you for this Qur´an nor am I a pretendermGan yagan Mi wa lada ndondo be ye yina eti etun nan mie lo nan boa mi ma la kpaka ndondo ta ye yea,
 This is no less than a Message to all the Worlds,Wun de fea sai sinsantu ya alitazhi kpaata
 This is no less than a Message to all the Worlds,Wun de fea sai sinsantu ya alitazhi kpaata
 And ye shall certainly know the truth of it all after a while,WALLAHI Ma yea be kpe gaskiya laabari nae yae na zunma lokaci ndocio 
 The revelation of this Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power full of Wisdom,Cin cin yan Litafi nnan dagan eba Soko bo nan yi Etsu zankpe nan u ma yi Etsu hikima nan
Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth so serve Allah offering Him sincere devotion,Akika Yi cin Litafi cin be ya wye be gaskiyae ebo acino fe jin bauta ya Soko wyo mao la adinio tadzuo yau
Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due But those who take for protectors other than Allah say We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to Allah Truly Allah will judge between them in that wherein they differ But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful,Akika adini natso ga tadzu nan u ga yi yan Soko za nanzhiy ma a gwasun kuti ndocizhi ke Soko lugwa nan ajin afe gan gan Yi yejin bauta jin ya kutizhi ebo a la yi yaa tsoaba Soko Akika Soko ga hukunci ba tsakaniabo eti yannazhi e la ce dozhi leba eti ubo nan Akika Sokoe la kafiri ndondo nan yi ganmanan zunci nan ke ekoa
 Had Allah wished to take to Himself a son He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He doth create but Glory be to Him! He is above such things He is Allah the One the Irresistible,Wunaba Soko ba gan wuna degi da wuna tsa za nan ga bau nan mini alittauzhio Lili kpata ajin tabbata yau akika wun ga yi Soko Etsu nini kete nan a ce alittazhi kpata kagbo nan
 He created the heavens and the earth in true proportions He makes the Night overlap the Day and the Day overlap the Night He has subjected the sun and the moon to His law Each one follows a course for a time appointed Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again,Wuna alitta yan sanmazhi to kin jin be gaskiyae wyune la yeshi fan a la kpe igidi umae la igidi fan kpe yeshio Uma igidi to etswa jin foro ya ye ndondoa eda zan har da iyaka ndoci nan a ba yau nan Akika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu gafara

Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky and leads it through springs in the earth Then He causes to grow therewith produce of various colours then it withers thou wilt see it grow yellow then He makes it dry up and crumble away Truly in this is a Message of remembrance to men of understanding,Ye leye gan Soko gae dule zhin dagan sanma boa Uciu laagan dan mini eye nuwan zhio nanzhiy fi kinbo naa Gancin U cie la yangici sun-sunzhi tinya iri irizhi Gancin U ci gaa wo uci gazhe dzukan dzukan Gancin uci gaa zun-ya Akika mini wuncino ayazhi danbo ya zanazhiy ga de ankali nan
 Is one whose heart Allah has opened to Islam so that he has received Enlightenment from Allah no better than one hard-hearted Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against celebrating the praises of Allah! they are manifestly wandering in error!,Ngba za nan Soko ga yangbanu fe gwigwoci ya musulunci nan u cia fe dan mini haskeo dagan nko Tsociubo nan U gazhe yeni be za nan yangbanu wuna tsu nae Akika azaba tsuntsunu wunajin tabbata ya zanan yangbanu gaa wo ke pipa Soko lugwa nan Zawuncinzhi a fe dan mini egbin nantso atula nan
Allah has revealed from time to time the most beautiful Message in the form of a Book consistent with itself yet repeating its teaching in various aspects the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat then their skins and their hearts do soften to the celebration of Allah´s praises Such is the guidance of Allah He guides therewith whom He pleases but such as Allah leaves to stray can have none to guide,Sokoa egan nan gye gan egan kpata nan cin be Litafi Alkuranu nan be dozhi nan u ma yi be fuska gubae gangba be labari yangbanfae Epa nankan kpace yan zanazhie sundan Soko nan wunajin ufe zhe dozhi be gbigbau yin epazhi mae la fu yeko yangbanazhi maashe be pipa Sokoe Wuncin bawu Soko Uyio za nan ma ga bau nan wune lau wuba be Alkuranuy Akika zaeni ndondo nan Soko gau gbin nan aa de zando naawuu ba wo be naa

 So Allah gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life but greater is the punishment of the Hereafter if they only knew!,Soko ci jina azaba yan zunyesun dan mini izheo gancin azaba yan efo alkiyami u gbota gan a ga kpe nan
We have put forth for men in this Qur´an every kind of Parable in order that they may receive admonition,Akika Yi la misalizhi dokun be ya zawangizhi fi mini Alkuranu nan nao eti alamari ndondo ebo ade baa laa sanatu
It is a Qur´an in Arabic without any crookedness therein in order that they may guard against Evil,Alkuranu nan yi azhimi Larubawazhi nan U ma de kinkan ndondoa ebo a fea tswa Soko

 If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth they would be sure to say Allah Say See ye then the things that ye invoke besides Allah- can they if Allah wills some Penalty for me remove His Penalty- Or if He wills some Grace for me can they keep back his Grace Say Sufficient is Allah for me!

 In what your wives leave your share is a half if they leave no child but if they leave a child ye get a fourth after payment of legacies and debts In what ye leave their share is a fourth if ye leave no child but if ye leave a child they get an eighth after payment of legacies and debts If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants but has left a brother or a sister each one of the two gets a sixth but if more than two they share in a third after payment of legacies and debts so that no loss is caused to any one Thus is it ordained by Allah and Allah is All-knowing Most Forbearing,Ye maade ganfi yan yanna yinmi yezhi ga lugwa dan zumao na Kagan ade egia na ammaa aga yi be egi ye yeade kansan nini yan kansan gunni mini yannazhi a yadan zumao na baci yan waswinci nauga jin na koma gbata wo yan gbata naugi na Atso yimiezhi ma yi be kansan nini yan kansan gunni mini yannazhi ye ga ya dan zumao na kagan yede egia na ammaa ye ga de gi roboa wuna yi kansan nini yan kansan gutota mini yannazhi yega lugwa dan zumao na baci yan waswinci na ye ga jin na ko ma gbata ya  yan gbata na ye gi na Uma gafe eza bagi naagi gun yan kalalana za na de egun gici gboko ko gwalaa na ko ma yinzagi ammaa uyi be yegi bagi ko yegi yinzagiy zaeni ndondo miniabo ade kansan nini yan kansan gutsunayin ama gaa dokun gan acin kpataa kebaa dan mini kansan nini yan kansan gutao baci yan gbata ya yan gbata nau gi na Wuncin mau ga la egun tswan egun ma Waswinci dano na dagan eba Soko Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hakuri uyio

 O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will Nor should ye treat them with harshness that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good,
,
But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower Take not the least bit of it back Would ye take it by slander and manifest wrong,Ye ma gae be kpa gan yea san yinmi gwa kinigiba yan yinmi ndoncio alali ma ye la dukiya yan kindari ewo bididi uyio ya zae ni miniabo ega gwo yandondo miniubo ma Kashi yea gwou umau laufe zunnbi gbonta be lefi naatula na

Also prohibited are women already married except those whom your right hands possess Thus hath Allah ordained Prohibitions against you Except for these all others are lawful provided ye seek them in marriage with gifts from your property- desiring chastity not lust seeing that ye derive benefit from them give them their dowers at least as prescribed but if after a dower is prescribed agree Mutually to vary it there is no blame on you and Allah is All-knowing All-wise,Mini nazhi yi haramu be na yinzagi nazhia yawo jina ni na sai de na egwa gwalo ye gaejin mulki na Ye mae tswahukunci Soko na Ujin ta eti ye bo na Ama ndondo naga dan zuma wuncinzhio na laajin ya ye Ye wa wo be dukiya yezhiy ye mae la yawoejin ye ga da yancin ma Gancin ema nazhi ye ga wo beayin na yea laada yan swadakia laaya wuncin mayi farilla

Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allah has given the one more strength than the other and because they support them from their means Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husband´s absence what Allah would have them guard As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct admonish them first Next refuse to share their beds And last beat them lightly but if they return to obedience seek not against them Means of annoyance For Allah is Most High great above you all,Bagizhi agayi eye ladancizhi yan yinzagizhio ebo falala na Soko laya sashiazhi ta eti yan sashio na to ebo yannazhi ewu dagan mini dukiyaazhio na To yinzagi kirikizhi za nazhie lamitu foro eba na ayio za nazhietswa eyan swiswoci na ayio kagan eba danboa na be kendoe Sokootso tsuutswa na Yinzagi nazhiima ye gae sundan gan abe zhi ragban na to e naa wun be wazi jiny ye mae lae kpeya bea yin elele bazhio kagana be gwo gana e wua Gancin ma aga bea emi tu ye ega gwo iyaka gan ta etiabo ma Akika Sokoafe Etsu elatu Etsu na wancin na

O ye who believe! Take your precautions and either go forth in parties or go forth all together,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E tswa shiri yan ekun yezhi gancin yecie tine yae dan kuno jama jamazhi ko ma ye tineya baenio
 There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind If a misfortune befalls you they say Allah did favour us in that we were not present among them,Akika ma ade dan mini yebo zanazhie dingun zhin zuma na Masiba ndoci gaa tswan ye U gan Akika boye yan Soko ta eti mi bo ebo na midan beayin ekunda boa-na
But if good fortune comes to you from Allah they would be sure to say - as if there had never been Ties of affection between you and them - Oh! I wish I had been with them a fine thing should I then have made of it!,Akika ma Wyunayi eryatwako yan Soko ndoci yeda deo kanga wunafe gan gan ke wyoa gan gan bo ye ndondo dan tsakani yebo lea na kasa re!

Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world for the hereafter To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah- whether he is slain or gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great value,Zanazhi gae kun izhe ebo ade eku na a naakina gunkuna dan eko Soko zandondo na gae gunkun dan eko Sokona aci Uwu na ko ma wyuna de galaba na to be leyin Yia yaU lada na wancin na
And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who being weak are ill-treated and oppressed- Men women and children whose cry is Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from thee one who will protect and raise for us from thee one who will help!,Ki mae jin ye yeo Yecie gunkun dan eko Soko boa naa yino Alali ma za nazhi a togbogun mini bagizhio to yinzagizhi to egizhi na egan gan Tsoci yi!

Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah and those who reject Faith Fight in the cause of Evil So fight ye against the friends of Satan feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan,Za nazhia imani jin na egun kun dan eko Soko za nazhi maajin kafirinci na egunkun dan eko Dagutuo za nae tswa ganmana ta Soko na Ebo acino egun masoyi shetan zhi kun akika tanadi shetan gbogun uyio
Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands from fight but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity When at length the order for fighting was issued to them behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah They said Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight Wouldst Thou not Grant us respite to our natural term near enough Say Short is the enjoyment of this world the Hereafter is the best for those who do right Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!,Kashi wyo ta ye cinle lo eba za nazhi agan ya gan Yea egwaezhi wandan ke ekun lugwa Ye mae la swallae ku kigini yemae feya zakka naa Gancin kamina abea ekun lajin wajibi ta etiabo na sashi miniabo cie sundan zawangizhi ke dasun Soko na ko ma na ganacin na Aci gan Tsoci yi!

 Wherever ye are death will find you out even if ye are in towers built up strong and high! If some good befalls them they say This is from Allah but if evil they say This is from thee O Prophet Say All things are from Allah But what hath come to these people that they fail to understand a single fact,Ban dondo na ye ga da dan na tsutsua tsune bagao kadama yegafe gun mini ekpakozhio naatu tsankuy lo sama na Alheri ndoci ma gaa dea agan gan Nana eba Soko bo ufe beo Egun ndoci maga tswana agan gan Nana eba wyoe bo ufe beo Gan gan kpata eba Soko boa fe beo To ki-ma jin za nana zhi acie jin fahimta egana yano
Whatever good O man! happens to thee is from Allah but whatever evil happens to thee is from thy own soul and We have sent thee as a messenger to instruct mankind And enough is Allah for a witness,Yandondo na ga tswan wye yan alheri na dagan eba Soko bo yan na ma ga tswan wye yan egun na dagan eba wyotso bo ufe beo Yi ma tun wyo tuntun wyo lao fe Tuci Soko lo eba zawangizhi Soko maa kunke Etsu eri
 He who obeys the Messenger obeys Allah But if any turn away We have not sent thee to watch over their evil deeds,Zandondo naga emitu Tuci na akika wyuna emitu Soko dano na za na ma ga zuma zheta na to Yi tun wyo tun fia gan wyo feo tswaao zaa
They have Obedience on their lips but when they leave thee a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them But Allah records their nightly plots So keep clear of them and put thy trust in Allah and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs,Acia fe gan gan Yi gwo yima emitu Gancin aga tinya dagan eba wyobo sashi miniabo a da le le be yandoci- dan yangbano naa ce leba natso wyo gan na Soko mae ka yannazhi apa fi yangbanona ebo acino adzun ganabo wyo mao lao yaokpe Soko Soko maakunke na wyuna gikini ya wuzhi na
 Do they not consider the Qur´an with care Had it been from other Than Allah they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy,Kashi ekpaye nashidu nakpa dan alamari Alkuranu boa da wunayi eba zandoci najin sokoa na bo ufe beo daatsun cice lebazhi dokun fi miniuboSurah When there comes to them some matter touching Public safety or fear they divulge it If they had only referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them the proper investigators would have Tested it from them direct Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of SatanAlamari ndoci maga beyaa yan aminci ko ma yan dansun ajin afe da gau miba za Daaci ganu kuda eba Tuci Soko to eba za nazhi ala alamarizhi fiagwao miniabo na dazanazhi gwoyin a wa dudugi wunaza na a kpe kendoe ugayi na Kagan umajin ebo falala Soko be yegunuyin na ta eti yebo naa da yega mitu shetan sai degi miniebo
Then fight in Allah´s cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment,Ebo acino fe gun kun ta eti eko Soko a maala kpakp ndoci a ta wyo yaa sai yan eti tacin wyotso Wyo maoya Muminizhi kwadari Kengi uyio na Sokoa kangwa egun kafirizhi na Soko ma gbota gan eba egun la tswan zao Soko ma gbota gan eba azaba jino
Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause shares in its burden And Allah hath power over all things,Zandondo na ga tangwa ya za gwatan wangi na wyuntsoade robo miniubo zandondo na ma ga tangwa ya za gwatan dede na tsunwan ndoci a danbo yan wuntso miniubo ma Soko maafe Etsu nae dan lokaci kangi ta eti yandondo na
When a courteous greeting is offered you meet it with a greeting still more courteous or at least of equal courtesy Allah takes careful account of all things,Ama ga be ci saye mi be emisa ndociy to ye saaega be natso ga gyegan wuncin na ko ma e saaga be iri natso a saye na Akika Sokoafe Etsu nae la lisafi eti yandondo na
Allah! There is no god but He of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt And whose word can be truer than Allah´s,Soko ade Tsoci ndocia sai wyin akika Ugae kuyekan da  Efo Alkiyami kelo kezhin ndondo ma dan miniuboa Zi-ma ta gaskiya a gan Soko eba labari ya bo
 Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites Allah hath upset them for their evil deeds Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way never shalt thou find the Way,To ki-jin ye yeo dan mini alamari munafikizhibo har yecia sa fi ena gubao alali ma Sokoagbinani ebo woce dede naa ce nao Kashi ye wawa gan yela za na Sokoagbin nae lae ke eko Zandondo na ma Soko gaubgin na eko ndoci ke yaU bea
 They but wish that ye should reject Faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah From what is forbidden But if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks,Ejin gan ye laejin kafirinci kendoe ajin kafirinci na ebo ye laezhe yeni Ebo acino ega da eyazhi dagan miniabo ma sai aga kpela dagan egbino zhin eko Soko Ama ga zuma zheta yea egwa suna ye mae wua badondo na ye ga dea na Ye mae ga la masoyi miniabo ma ye mae ga la taimako jinci miniabo ma
Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty of peace or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people If Allah had pleased He could have given them power over you and they would have fought you Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not and instead send you Guarantees of peace then Allah Hath opened no way for you to war against them,Sai de za nazhi gaada gun be jamaa ndocizhi-na nazhi-ma tsakani yebo bea yin alkawali danbo na ko ma za nazhi gabe eba ye be yangban wiwanci na ke ayaa gun ye kuna amaa gun to zabaa tsozhi kuna na Dawunaba Soko ba Ugaa ya kagbo ta eti yebo da amaagune kun To aga bea kpeya be ye yin a ma gun ye kuna gancin aci gan ayewa edunfe lafiya be ye yin to Soko la kagbo ndoci yaye ta etiabo bea
Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people Every time they are sent back to temptation they succumb thereto if they withdraw not from you nor give you guarantees of peace besides restraining their hands seize them and slay them wherever ye get them In their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them,Ye make tsun zandocizhi be ewa gan ye yaa aminci ye mae ya jamaa yanazhi edunfe yan aminci Kandondo na fitina gaa na na a kpatsunzhi din danbo kagan a kpeya be ye yina atso ma be wa edunfe lafiya be ye yina ama wan egwaazhi dana to ya gwa suna ye mae wua bandondo na yega tsoa gwa na Zawuncizhi Yi la kagbo naatu la na ya ye ta etiabo
Never should a believer kill a believer but If it so happens by mistake Compensation is due If one so kills a believer it is ordained that he should free a believing slave and pay compensation to the deceased´s family unless they remit it freely If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you and he was a believer the freeing of a believing slave Is enough If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance compensation should be paid to his family and a believing slave be freed For those who find this beyond their means is prescribed a fast for two months running by way of repentance to Allah for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom,Uma gwoyin na Muminizhi muslumi a wu Mumini naa sai de eti bicicino Za na ma ga bea Mumini wu eti bicicino na sai wyunu wa wuzhi na yi Mumini na U lau yagi be ewo egya na wyuna laya za miuzhina sai de atso ga gangan a jin swadaka Gancin za na a wuna gafe dagan mini jamaa ndocizhio nazhi yi makiri yezhi na za na maawu na mayi musulumi sai a la wuzhi Musulumia yagi Uma gafe dagan mini jamaa nazhi- tsakani yebo bea yin alkawali danbo na sai yela ewo egya diyya e lae ya za miuzhi gani be wuzhi Musulumi naaya egi na Za na be de iko wuzhia na sai wyunu la azum yan etswa guba lamitu dozhiufe Nana ga yi tuba jin dagan eba Soko bo Soko maafe Etsu kpikpe Etsu hikima

O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah investigate carefully and say not to any one who offers you a salutation Thou art none of a believer! Coveting the perishable goods of this life with Allah are profits and spoils abundant Even thus were ye yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His favours Therefore carefully investigate For Allah is well aware of all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

 Not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home Unto all in Faith Hath Allah promised good But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit at home by a special reward,Za nazhi fedunazhizhi mini Musulumizhio aci lo ekun gunzhia naUmayi be uzuri kpoki yina na a jin yeni be za nazhie gun kun dan eko Soko be dukiyaazhi to be rayiazhi na laa ta eti za nazhi zhizhi na be daraja na wancin nae Ndondoa ma Soko jina alkawali yan egagba wangi ammaade Sokoa daraja laaya za nazhie gunkun na ta eti za nazhia fe dun na daraja na ma wancin na

When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls they say In what plight Were ye They reply Weak and oppressed Were we in the earth They say Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away From evil Such men will find their abode in Hell- What an evil refuge! ,Akika za nazhi Malaikazhie gwo rayiazhi na alali ma a fe dan hali yan za nazhia eti tacina jin gun na acie gan gan Hali kici ye dany ninbo Acim gan Yi ya fe za nazhi a to gbogun fi kinbo na Aci gan Asa kin yan Soko ujin gwugwo cia na yea kpela fi bo naa To zawuncinzhi ezhe kebaa yi Ena Jahannama Ezhe keba wuncin maa bi ye

For these there is hope that Allah will forgive For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and againZawuncizhi kengi uyio na Sokoa fa beayin na Sokoma wyunafe Etsu fifa Etsu gafara,
He who forsakes his home in the cause of Allah finds in the earth Many a refuge wide and spacious Should he die as a refugee from home for Allah and His Messenger His reward becomes due and sure with Allah And Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na gae kpela dan eko Soko na wyuna tsun ebazhi na dokun na fi kinbo ganni be bagwae Za na ma ga bea tinya dagan emiubo na eti kpikpelao dan eko Soko be Tuciu yin na gancin ajali ci beu la na akika lada yan za wuncin wunafe ta eti Soko Soko maafe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun

 When thou O Messenger art with them and standest to lead them in prayer Let one party of them stand up in prayer with thee Taking their arms with them When they finish their prostrations let them Take their position in the rear And let the other party come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them pray with thee Taking all precaution and bearing arms the Unbelievers wish if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage to assault you in a single rush But there is no blame on you if ye put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because ye are ill but take every precaution for yourselves For the Unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment,Wyo ma gaafe dan miniabo a swalla ku gikini bea yin to kansan ndoci miniabo abea gikini be wyo yin amaala gwaasun kaya kunazhi Gancin aga swalla jin to ada gikini zuma yebo Gancin kansan baci yan jamaa nazhi laajin swallaa na a cia daabe atso cia la swallaajin be wyo yin Amatswa shiriazhi to kaya ekunazhi kafirizhiejin guri gan ye lae yaye le kaya kun yezhi to kaya yezhie lugwa ebo aala pan azhin eti ye pin panzhin yan baeni Lefi ma danbo yaye yea egun ndoci ga bea tswan ye dagan bayeko eleo ko ma ye ci jin cigun na yea la kaya ekun yezhi zhizhi naa ye mae tswa shiriyezhi Akika Sokoa shiri jin ya kafirizhi yan azaba yan zunye sun

 But seek the forgiveness of Allah for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most MercifulWyo mao wa gafara Soko Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio,
 Contend not on behalf of such as betray their own souls for Allah loveth not one given to perfidy and crime,Wyo mao ga gbomi ya za nazhie jin eti tacina hainci na ma Akika Sokoe wa zanae dokun be hainci jiny naa Umae wa za nae dokun be lefi jiny naa
 They may hide Their crimes from men but they cannot hide Them from Allah seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night in words that He cannot approve And Allah Doth compass round all that they do,A jin afe wa gnaa swoa ya zawangizhi amae wa gan a swoa ya sokoa alali ma Soko dan beayin lokaci na afe lele be yannazhi Soko jin yeda be yina na dan yangbano na mae gan tinya na Soko maafe Etsu na yannazhi ejin kpata na makezhe na

But for the Grace of Allah to thee and his Mercy a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead thee astray But in fact they will only Lead their own souls astray and to thee they can do no harm in the least For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou Knewest not before And great is the Grace of Allah unto thee,Kaujinmebo falala yan Soko na ta eti wyo bo be yegunU yin naa da ndocizhi a jin kokari gan a la wyo yaagbin Amagbin zandondo woa sai de eti tacinatso ama jin wyo gun wo be yandondo yina Soko ma cin Litafi to hikima bea ya wyoe Uma ya wyoe kpikpe yan yannazhi wyo kpe shibo lea na Akika falala Soko na ta eti wyobo na u wancin

Allah did curse him but he said I will take of Thy servants a portion Marked off,Soko mau bo mi Uci gan akika miga jamaa mini wuzhi wyozhio na ekundoa yi bibaci na laadin dan egbino 
I will mislead them and I will create in them false desires I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the fair nature created by Allah Whoever forsaking Allah takes satan for a friend hath of a surety suffered a loss that is manifest,Akika ma migaagbin mima ga guri kwarwa ladana yangbanazhio mi maajina foro gan a la tukpa dab azhia koa ya dabba nazhie la wo kutizhi na akika mia jina foro ebo ala alitta Sokoa zhegba Akika zandondo na ga sheitan la eya maci ke Soko lugwa na akika wyunajin hasara hasara na maatula na

 If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband´s part there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves and such settlement is best even though men´s souls are swayed by greed But if ye do good and practise self-restraint Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Yinzagi gabea fe gan wyune sundan yan eyewu ko zuma zheta dagan eba ebaubo lefi danboa na a wa gyara tsakaniabo be dozhi naa uga de alheri gano Ama yanbotan lashi yangban zawangi zhio Amma ye gafe yecie jin bolobolo yecie sundan Soko wuncin gye gan akika ma Soko a fe Etsu nayi be labari etun nazhi yelo kpata na

Those who believe then reject faith then believe again and again reject faith and go on increasing in unbelief- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na gancin aci kezhea imani jin aci kezhe jin kafirinci gancin kezhea be ta eti kafirinci jino na Soko fe Etsu naajina gafara naa U maa laake eko gurua
To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them but a grievous penalty-La bushara ya munafikizhi kede akaika azaba na tan sarauyin na gaajin tabbata yaa Bushara= labari,
Yea to those who take for friends unbelievers rather than believers is it honour they seek among them Nay- all honour is with Allah,Za nazhie da la kafirizhi eya mancizhi ke Muminizhi lugwa na be ke ewa zankpe ndoci wa za dagan gwataabo na Ngan akika zankpe kpata eba Soko bou dano
Already has He sent you Word in the Book that when ye hear the signs of Allah held in defiance and ridicule ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme if ye did ye would be like them For Allah will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell,Akika ma Soko cin be ya ye dan mini Litafio kede ye gae be wo aya yan Soko zhi acie jin kafirinci bea yin acie la mi bea yin yega fedun beayin kanga be ma sai aga bea lo dan eza ndoci najin wuncina na Akika ye ga fedun bea yin kanga yegaazhe dozhina eba lefio Akika Soko ga munafikizhi to kafirizhi kpata ku yekan fi ena Jahannamao
These are the ones who wait and watch about you if ye do gain a victory from Allah they say Were we not with you- but if the unbelievers gain a success they say to them Did we not gain an advantage over you and did we not guard you from the believers but Allah will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way to triumphs over the believers,Za nazhie la ye tu ye yanna gatswan ye na harma nasara ndoci gaade ye dagan eba soko agan Asa ujin be yeyin ga yi dana Umaa yi kafirizhi ga-be de rabo ndocio agan Asa yi zan ye kpea Yi ma ke kangwa ya ye be Muminizhi yina To Soko ga hukunci jin tsakaniebo be dozhiy Efo Alkiyamiy Soko maala kagbo ya kafirizhi ta eti Muminizhi boa
The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching Allah but He will over-reach them When they stand up to prayer they stand without earnestness to be seen of men but little do they hold Allah in remembrance,Akika munafikizhi ajin afe ta Soko eba yekpaabo alali ma Soko gaa wo gbata be etaazhiy kamina aga nakin da jin swalla na enakin na be nakan gbane Ejin jin ebo zawangizhia leye amae pa Sokoa sai degi
 They are distracted in mind even in the midst of it- being sincerely for neither one group nor for another whom Allah leaves straying- never wilt thou find for him the way,Ceka celozhin zhi ayio dan tacin wuncin bo adan mini zannazhio loloa Ama dan mini zan nazhio loloaZandondo na Soko gaU gbin na wyoade eko guru ndoci la yau bea
 O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la kafirizhi masoyizhi ke Muminizhi lugwa ma Kashi ye wawa gan yela dalili yan gbangbae lae wu Soko na Uga wan ye na
 The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire no helper wilt thou find for them,Akika munafikizhi afi mini tako yan gushe na gba gan mini enao na wyo maade taimako jinci ndondo yaa
Except for those who repent mend their lives hold fast to Allah and purify their religion as in Allah´s sight if so they will be numbered with the believers And soon will Allah grant to the believers a reward of immense value,Sai de za nazhi ga tuba jin acia miniazhi yejin acia gwasun bawu Soko acia edzuta laadan jin jin adinio ebo Soko toza wuncinzhi dan mini Muminizhio Soko maala egagba na wancin na ya Muminizhi
 What can Allah gain by your punishment if ye are grateful and ye believe Nay it is Allah that recogniseth all good and knoweth all things,Ki-yi yan na Soko de dajin yan anfani be azaba jin ye yin nao ye gafe eza yebojinzhi yeci kezhea imani jin nao Soko maafe Etsu yebojin Etsu kpikpe
Allah loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech except where injustice hath been done for Allah is He who heareth and knoweth all things,Sokoe wa lilatu yan eyan dede mini eganboa sai de za na ga jinu zwalunci na Soko maafe Etsu nae wo yandondo na Etsu kpikpe
Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon verily Allah doth blot out sins and hath power in the judgment of values,Ye ga alheri latu ko ma yeciuswo ko ma yeci fa be lefi egun najin ye na egagba yandondo dan be Sokoe Akika ma Sokoa fe Etsu nae fa na Etsu na de iko ta eti yandondo na
They are in truth equally unbelievers and we have prepared for unbelievers a humiliating punishment,Za wuncinzhi ga yi kafirizhi yan haki kao yi ma shiri jin ya kafirizhi yan azaba yan zunyesun
 To those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of the messengers we shall soon give their due rewards for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Za nazhi-ma a imani jin be Sokoe ganni be TuciUzhi-na ama la erikpe ndoci dan tsakania boa na za wuncinzhi be leyin aga egagbaa laaya Soko maafe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun
The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater miracle for they said Show us Allah in public but they were dazed for their presumption with thunder and lightning Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs had come to them even so we forgave them and gave Moses manifest proofs of authority,Jamaa nazhiala Litafi ya na egbin wyo gan gan wyoocin Litafi ndocio yaa dagan samao Akika agbin Musa gan yan yan na gbota gan acin na leani aci gan La Soko wu yi gbangbae yi- leu ye Kabara yan sanma cia wan ebo zwalunci naajin na gancin acia nanko gigi la cie jin bauta ya baci na hujjazhi nazhia tula dabe yaa ni na yicia fa be wunciny Yicia dalili naatula na laya MusaSurah And for their covenant we raised over them the towering height of Mount Sinai and on another occasion we said Enter the gate with humility and once again we commanded them Transgress not in the matter of the sabbath And we took from them a solemn covenantYicia pati yan Turu laaketo ta fitiabo ebo alkawaliabo yi ma gan yagan Yea gandan eko be ekpyade Yi ci ke gan a gan Ega kara gwo iyaka gan dan Asibio ma Yi ma gwo alkawali na lekpan na dagan ebaabo
They have incurred divine displeasure In that they broke their covenant that they rejected the signs of Allah that they slew the Messengers in defiance of right that they said Our hearts are the wrappings which preserve Allah´s Word We need no more- Nay Allah hath set the seal on their hearts for their blasphemy and little is it they believe,Ebo luloya yan alkawaliazhi be kafirincia yin be aya Soko zhi be wuwu Annabizhi na jin eti hakki ndondo boa na be egan nazhie dagan gan Yangbanazhi a yaba wunatsu Aa Soko dea yangbanazhi te-ebo kafirinci naejin nao Ebo acino ajin imania sai degi
That they rejected Faith that they uttered against Mary a grave false charge,To ebo kafirincio to egan naagan eti Maryamuo na yi ganmana tswitswaci gbonta na
That they said in boast We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary the Messenger of Allah- but they killed him not nor crucified him but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no certain knowledge but only conjecture to follow for of a surety they killed him not,To gingan naagan gan Yi yia Isa egi Maryamu na yi Tuci Soko na wu alali ma a wu wyuna ama fou sa ammaa a eza laabeu fia Akika ma za nazhi- ce dozhi leba eti alamariubo na ejin kelokezhin dan miniubo ade hakika yan kpikpe etiuboa sai de yekpa nae la mi tu na a ma wuu eba hakika boa

That they took usury though they were forbidden and that they devoured men´s substance wrongfully- we have prepared for those among them who reject faith a grievous punishment,To ewo yan ribaewo nuwan nae gwo na alali maa kan jin jin wuncin leani to ewo zazhi nae giayan eti ganmanao na Yi ma shiri jin ya kafirizhi miniabo yan azaba nayi tintanci na
But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge and the believers believe in what hath been revealed to thee and what was revealed before thee And especially those who establish regular prayer and practise regular charity and believe in Allah and in the Last Day To them shall We soon give a great reward,Ammaade za nazhia shidu dan kpikpeo miniabo na to Muminizhi a imani jin be yanna acin be shi wyo dzo nae To zanazhi mae ku swalla gikini na to za nazhie wa zakka na to zanzhia imani jin be Sokoe to Efo zobae na za wuncinzhi kpata yia la egagba na wancin na yaa
 We have sent thee inspiration as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him we sent inspiration to Abraham Isma´il Isaac Jacob and the Tribes to Jesus Job Jonah Aaron and solomon and to David We gave the Psalms,Akikayi jin wahyi be ya wyoe dozhin kendoe Yi jin wahyi be ya Nuhu na to Annabizhi nazhi be zumaubona Yima kejin wahyi ya Ibrahima to Ismaila to Ishaqa to Yakuba to yagizhi to Isa to Ayuba to Yunusa to Haruna to Sulaimanu Yima la Litafi zabura ya Dawuda
 Of some messengers We have already told thee the story of others We have not- and to Moses Allah spoke direct,To Tuci ndocizhi danbo Yia labariazhi la ya wyoe leani Tuci ndocizhi ma danbo Yi la labariazhi ya wyo yaa Soko ma gangan be Musae egan yan hakika
Messengers who gave good news as well as warning that mankind after the coming of the messengers should have no plea against Allah For Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,Tucizhi ayio eya labari yangban fazhi a mayi za nazhie na wun na ebo zawangizhia gade hujjandondo ta eti Soko-ma baci na wyuna Tucizhi tuntunani na Soko maafe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima
 But Allah beareth witness that what He hath sent unto thee He hath sent from His own knowledge and the angels bear witness But enough is Allah for a witness,Ammaade Sokootso ejin ri be yanna Ucin ya wyo na Ucinucin be kpikpe Uyin Malaikazhio tsoejin ri Sokootso makun Eri
 Those who reject Faith and keep off men from the way of Allah have verily strayed far far away from the Path,Akika zanazhiajin kafirinci na aci kan zawangizhi zan ta eti eko Soko na akika zawuncinzhia gbin egbin na ma kpeya na
Those who reject Faith and do wrong- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to any way,Akika za nazhi-jin kafirinci na a ma jin zwalunci na Ufe yanna gwoyin ya Soko na wyuna jina gafara naa Uma gwoyin na wyuna wuaba ta eko gboro naa
Except the way of Hell to dwell therein for ever And this to Allah is easy,Sai de eko yan Jahannama baga bo maafi tutun yino wuncin ma eyan fifanci uyi ya Soko
 O Mankind! The Messenger hath come to you in truth from Allah believe in him It is best for you But if ye reject Faith to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth And Allah is All-knowing All-wise,Ya ye zawangizhi! Akika Tuci Soko dabe yaye be gaskiyae dagan eba Tsoci yebo ebo acino yea imani jin wuncin fe alheri yaye gan Ye ma gabeajin kafirinci to akika Soko ga wun mulki yannazhi fi sanmazhio to kin bo nao Soko maafe Etsu kpikpe Etsu hikima
 O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion Nor say of Allah aught but the truth Christ Jesus the son of Mary was no more than a messenger of Allah and His Word which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit proceeding from Him so believe in Allah and His messengers Say not Trinity  desist it will be better for you for Allah is one Allah Glory be to Him far exalted is He above having a son To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs,Ya ye za ba Litafizhi!

Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship Allah nor do the angels those nearest to Allah those who disdain His worship and are arrogant-He will gather them all together unto Himself to answer,Masihu Isa u sungwo lea na ugaafe wuzhi ya Soko naa acinga ga Malaikazhi nazhi yi za tsonbazhi nao Zandondo na gae sungwo yan bauta na wyunajin ya Soko na ucie la ti danfino na to akika Soko gaaku yekan baenio zhin ebaU
But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness He will give their due rewards- and more out of His bounty But those who are disdainful and arrogant He will punish with a grievous penalty Nor will they find besides Allah any to protect or help them,Ammade zanazhia imani jin a ci lotun wangizhina Soko ga laadazhi shekpan yaa umaabea dagan mini falalauzhio zanazhima gae la gwosun wu imani na a cie gbotika na to Sokoa jina azaba na tan na amaade zunma Soko Ndakata ndoci ko taimako jinci ndociaSurah  O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord For We have sent unto you a light that is manifestYa ye zawangizhi!

The revelation of this Book is from Allah Exalted in Power Full of Knowledge-,Cin cin yan Litafi nan nan dagan eba Soko bo u fe beo Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio
 Who forgiveth sin accepteth repentance is strict in punishment and hath a long reach in all things there is no god but He to Him is the final goal,Etsu nae jin gafara yan zunubi nan Etsu nae gwo tuba nan Etsu na gbota eba azabao nan Etsu bagwo ade yandoci nan ajin bauta ya naa sai Soko ezhekeba kpata yan yandondo ebaubo udano
None can dispute about the Signs of Allah but the Unbelievers Let not then their strutting about through the land deceive thee!,Ade za naa gbomi be aya Soko zhiy naa sai de za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nan ebo acino ga lugwa dalo dazhinazhi fi ezhizhio wuna wyo ta ma
 But there were people before them who denied the Signs- the People of Noah and the Confederates of Evil after them and every People plotted against their prophet to seize him and disputed by means of vanities therewith to condemn the Truth but it was I that seized them! and how terrible was My Requital!,Jamaa yan Annabi Nuhuzhi a egan Soko yi ganmanan shidzo bedzo to Ahzabuzhi zunma yana bo alumma ndondo ma jin kokari nan a ga Tuchiazhi wan wu nan Amaa ganmanan laa sungwa cife gbomi ebo a la gaskiya a gbina ya Mi Soko cia wan kpantsukuy ngba ke azaba yan winwan Soko yi yi naoAcinga gao egan misun yan Tsoci wye wunajin tabbata ta eti za nazhie jin kafirinci naokede egimi nazhi a yio nan
Thus was the Decree of thy Lord proved true against the Unbelievers that truly they are Companions of the Fire!,Acinga gao egan misun yan Tsoci wye wunajin tabbata ta eti za nazhie jin kafirinci nao kede egimi nazhi a yio nan
 Those who sustain the Throne of Allah and those around it Sing Glory and Praise to their Lord believe in Him and implore Forgiveness for those who believe Our Lord! Thy Reach is over all things in Mercy and Knowledge Forgive then those who turn in Repentance and follow Thy Path and preserve them from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire!,Malaika nazhi la Alarashi nan to nazhiy e mau kezhe nan eli Tsocia zhi tsa tsa ganni be yebo jinjya u A maejin imani beu yin amae ba gafara ya Muminizhi e gan gan Ya Wye Tsoci yi akika bagwo Wye wuna yandondo ma kezhe ganni be yeguny be kpikpe Soko fa be za nanzhi ga tuba jin nan ama emitu eko Wyo na Wyo mao taaotu b e azaba jahimuy

The Unbelievers will be addressed Greater was the aversion of Allah to you than is your aversion to yourselves seeing that ye were called to the Faith and ye used to refuse,Akika za nazhi ajin kafirinci na aayia gan akika ewunzhe yan Soko u gbota gan ewunzhe yan yetso be dozhi kaminan afe yi ye gan ye bejin imani na yeci fejin kafirinci
They will say Our Lord! twice hast Thou made us without life and twice hast Thou given us Life! Now have we recognised our sins Is there any way out of this,A ci gan Tsoci yi Wyoa yi wu zu guba Wyo ma yi dan rayi zu guba yi maa gwo gan yi yawyo jin leifi ngba yiade wandzun dagan azaba boa
The answer will be This is because when Allah was invoked as the Only object of worship ye did reject Faith but when partners were joined to Him ye believed! the Command is with Allah Most High Most Great!,Wuncin na tswa ye daa na u yi ebo na kandondo na aga Soko Tunye gbaugi na ye laaajin kafirinci ama ga eyan laapau baci ye la gaskiya ya nan-nan hukunci yan Soko U yio Etsu na wun ela tu na Etsu na wancin nan

Call ye then upon Allah with sincere devotion to Him even though the Unbelievers may detest it,E fe jin bauta ya Soko ye mae la adinie tadzue yau gbaugi ka ma kafirizhi gae nanvo
 Raised high above ranks or degrees He is the Lord of the Throne of Authority by His Command doth He send the Spirit of inspiration to any of His servants he pleases that it may warn men of the Day of Mutual Meeting-,Etsu na latu be darajazhi na Etsu Alarashi Wune cin wahayi be dagan mini forou bo ya za na ga bau mini wuzhiu zhio na ebo u de bau nanwun eti efo bakeoEfo na alittazhi kpata gaakebanan

 Warn them of the Day that is ever drawing near when the hearts will come right up to the throats to choke them No intimate friend nor intercessor will the wrong-doers have who could be listened to,Wyo mao jina gangba yan efo nana tsoba nan kanga yangbanzhi ga nakin ebo dansuno yangbanzhi ganyin  Azwalumizhi ade eya fo gaa amade za naa tangwa yaa acia gwo gwatanu naa
Allah knows of the tricks that deceive with the eyes and all that the hearts of men conceal,Soko de kpikpe yan eye nae yi haramu cin le nan u ma de kpikpr yan nanzhiy swo fi yangbanzhio nan
And Allah will judge with justice and Truth but those whom men invoke besides Him will not be in a position to judge at all Verily it is Allah alone Who hears and sees all things,Soko mae jin hukunci jin be gaskiyae za nanzhiy mae jin bauta ya baci Soko nan e jin hukunci be yandondo yina sai ganmanan Akika Soko ga yi Etsu nae wo yandondo nao Uma yi Etsu nae cin yandondo le nan
Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them They were even superior to them in strength and in the traces they have left in the land but Allah did call them to account for their sins and none had they to defend them against Allah,Kashi e za za kpe eti kinboa acia cina le kendoe zoba za nanzhiy shidzo nan yi yi naa Ngan za wuncin zhi gboka nakano gana ama de ebazhi dokun gana fi kinbo Soko cia wan be zunubiazhiy ama de zandondo naa kangwa yaa naa
That was because there came to them their messengers with Clear Signs but they rejected them So Allah called them to account for He is Full of Strength Strict in Punishment,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan Tuchiazhi fe be ya be bayanizhiy acia jin kafirinci Soko cia wan akika Soko gboka Uma gbota eba azaba jino
Of old We sent Moses with Our Signs and an authority manifest,Akika Yi tun Annabi Musa tun ganni be aya Yizhiy be hujja naa tula nan
 To Pharaoh Haman and Qarun but they called him a sorcerer telling lies!,Yi tunu fi Firauna to Hamana to Karuna aci gan eyan maci uyio ganmanan zunci ma uyio
Now when he came to them in Truth from Us they said Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep alive their females but the plots of Unbelievers end in nothing but errors and delusions!,Kaminan u la gaskiya be yaa dagan eba Yi bo nan a gan yea egi yan zananzhiy ga gaskiya ya beu yin nan wu ye mae la ynzagiazhie lugwa Akika tanadi kafirizhi u fe dan bandondo boa sai de egbino
 Said Pharaoh Leave me to slay Moses and let him call on his Lord! What I fear is lest he should change your religion or lest he should cause mischief to appear in the land!,Firauna ci gan Yea mi ya minla Musa n-wu umau dauyi Tsoci wunu be akika mie sundan ubea adini ye zhe gba ma ko ma ube jin barna kpe eti kinbo ma
Moses said I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord for protection from every arrogant one who believes not in the Day of Account!,Annabi Musa ci gan Akika mie wa tswitswa dagan eba Tsoci mi be Tsoci ye yin utswa yi be egun yan eti kagboci ndondoe nan jin imani be efo egagba yina nan
A believer a man from among the people of Pharaoh who had concealed his faith said Will ye slay a man because he says ´My Lord is Allah´- when he has indeed come to you with Clear Signs from your Lord and if he be a liar on him is the sin of his lie but if he is telling the Truth then will fall on you something of the calamity of which he warns you Truly Allah guides not one who transgresses and lies!,Eza bagi ndoci nan yi Mumini mini zami Firaunazhionae swo imaniu nan gan Ye ga eza baginna wu ebo nan ugan gan Soko ga yi Tsoci mi yino nan Akika ma ube ya ye be ayazhiy dagan eba Tsoci ye bo Wunayi ganmana-zunci uyio wuntso ga wuna wuyan yao Umaayi gaskiya wune tao sashi yan egan azaba nan wune laajin ye alkawali nan ga tswane Akika Soko ejin za nan gaafe eyan nyinci ganmanan zunci nan shiria
 O my People! Yours is the dominion this day Ye have the upper hand in the land but who will help us from the Punishment of Allah should it befall us Pharaoh said I but point out to you that which I see myself Nor do I guide you but to the Path of Right!,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi!

Then said the man who believed O my people! Truly I do fear for you something like the Day of disaster of the Confederates in sin!-,Za nan ma a imani jin be Sokoe nan gan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi akika mie sundan ya ye yan azaba Soko iri nan u jin jamaa ndocizhi nan zhi a miniazhi kpa ena ena nan
 Something like the fate of the People of Noah the ´Ad and the Thamud and those who came after them but Allah never wishes injustice to his Servants,Iri azaba yan jamaa yan Annabi Nuhu zhi to yan Aduzhi to Samuduzhi to za nanzhiy be zunmaabo nan Akika Sokoe kpa zwalunci ya wuzhiuzhia
 And O my people! I fear for you a Day when there will be Mutual calling and wailing-,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi akika mie sundan ya ye yan efo nan zawangizhi afe yi dozhi ye nan
A Day when ye shall turn your backs and flee No defender shall ye have from Allah Any whom Allah leaves to stray there is none to guide,Efo nan ye ga zunma ya dozhi nan yecia fe bici zandondo danbo naa kangwa ya ye naa Akika zandondo nan Soko gagbin nan wuna de zandondo naa lau ke eko wo naa
And to you there came Joseph in times gone by with Clear Signs but ye ceased not to doubt of the Mission for which he had come At length when he died ye said ´No messenger will Allah send after him´ thus doth Allah leave to stray such as transgress and live in doubt-,Akika Annabi Yusufu be ya ye shidzo be be hujjazhiy amma ye pan yeshia ye dan mini kelokezhino be yan nan u la be ya ye nae har da lokaci nan ajali wunajin nan ye ci gan Sokoa kara tun Tucin-dondo tun zunmau bo bea Acinga ga Sokoe gbin zaeni ndondo nan gaafe eyan nyinci nao za nae dokun be kelokezhin jiny nan
Such as dispute about the Signs of Allah without any authority that hath reached them grievous and odious is such conduct in the sight of Allah and of the Believers Thus doth Allah seal up every heart - of arrogant and obstinate Transgressors,Za nanzhie gbomi dan mini aya Soko zhio u ma yibe hujja ndoci nan be yaa naa nan Nan nan eyan gwosun uyio nan gbota eba Soko nan uma gbota eba muminizhio Acinga ga Sokoe na yangban yan zandondo nan gaafe eza eti kagboci uma yi eza dede nao
Pharaoh said O Haman! Build me a lofty palace that I may attain the ways and means-,Firauna ci gan Ya wye Hamanu! A kata fiti nan wunkpa nan tu ya mi Ujin wo min tun ekpa yan sanmazhi
 The ways and means of reaching the heavens and that I may mount up to the god of Moses But as far as I am concerned I think Moses is a liar! Thus was made alluring in Pharaoh´s eyes the evil of his deeds and he was hindered from the Path and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but perdition for him,Wato Ekpa yan sanmazhi ebo mindan-shiye-ncin Soko yan Musanle ebo nan mie kpau ye gan ganmanan zunci wuna yio Acinga ga ala etun dede Firauna cia panin fi wuno aciu pan ya ke eko wangi lugwa Akika tanadi Firauna kpata ufea sai dai na ga wuntso jin hallaka na
 The man who believed said further O my people! Follow me I will lead you to the Path of Right,Za nan ma imani jin nan miniabo nan gan Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi yea mi tu mi mia wue ba lo eko nan tso yi gboro nan
O my people! This life of the present is nothing but temporary convenience It is the Hereafter that is the Home that will last,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! Akika eman yan izhe nanan eman uyio nan yi zwizwoci nan akika ma emi yan zoba batsozhi u ga yi emi yan tutun yino
He that works evil will not be requited but by the like thereof and he that works a righteous deed - whether man or woman - and is a Believer- such will enter the Garden of Bliss Therein will they have abundance without measure,Zaeni ndondo nan ga lo etun dede nan agaugbaa sai de be iriu yin za nan maga lo etun wangi nan mini bagizhio ko ynzagizhio na U maa imani jin nan akika za wuncin zhi gaa gandan Aljannao afe yaa arzikizhi nan de lisafia nan
And O my people! How strange it is for me to call you to Salvation while ye call me to the Fire!,Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! kiy la mie yi ye lo eko gwagan ye mae yi mi lo eko enao
Ye do call upon me to blaspheme against Allah and to join with Him partners of whom I have no knowledge and I call you to the Exalted in Power Who forgives again and again!,Ye yimi gan minla kafirinci-njin be Sokoe mi man la yandoci nan mide kpikpe wuna nan minlan pau baci mi mae yi ye zhin eba Etsu nan wun zankpe kpata nan Etsu nan yi Etsu gafara nan
Without doubt ye do call me to one who is not fit to be called to whether in this world or in the Hereafter our return will be to Allah and the Transgressors will be Companions of the Fire!,Akika kelokezhin ndondo danboa yannan ye yi mi gan min ben tsun nan u de kinigiba ndondo izhe boa uma de to alkiyami boa akika ezhekeba yi kpata ma be Soko yinu dano akika ma za nanzhie nyin yanzhi kpe eti kinbo nan a ga yi egimi nazhio
 Then Allah saved him from every ill that they plotted against him but the burnt of the Penalty encompassed on all sides the People of PharaohSoko ci kangwa tanadi dede nanzhiy ajin nan yau azaba dede maajin tabbata ta eti jamaa yan Firauna zhio,
In front of the Fire will they be brought morning and evening And the sentence will be on the Day that Judgment will be established Cast ye the People of Pharaoh into the severest Penalty!,Enan uyio afe kua da fibo to lazhin to lozun Efo Alkiyami gaa tun a gana gan Yea zami Firaunazhi ku fi azaba tsuntsun nuo
 Behold they will dispute with each other in the Fire! The weak ones who followed will say to those who had been arrogant We but followed you Can ye then take on yourselves from us some share of the Fire,Kanga a fe gbomi be dozhiy fi mini enao eza gbogun zhi a fe gan be nunsaazhiy akika ye ga yi fe lamitu izhe bo Ngba yea gwo gwa yandoci wo ya yi mini azaba enao
Those who had been arrogant will say We are all in this Fire! Truly Allah has judged between his Servants!,Nunsa nanzhi gboti ka nan cia gan gan Akika kpata yi de yia fe fi mini ena boani akika ma Sokoa hukunci ba tsakani wuzhizhi boa ni
 Those in the Fire will say to the Keepers of Hell Pray to your Lord to lighten us the Penalty for a day at least!,Egimi nazhi cia kpemi gan gan be malaika nazhie pa jahannama nan gan E tan Tsoci ye gwa ya yi ujin sauki kawuna yi yan foe nio ya yi-yiy
They will say Did there not come to you your messengers with Clear Signs They will say Yes They will reply Then pray as ye like! But the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but futile wandering in mazes of error!,Malaikazhi ci gan A sa- Tuci yezhi a la bayanizhi be ya ye yea A ci gan Acingao niy Acia gan gan Efe ba aduwa akika aduwa kafirizhi kpata ma eyan yiyaci uyio
We will without doubt help our messengers and those who believe both in this world´s life and on the Day when the Witnesses will stand forth-,Akika Yiajin Tuci Yizhi taimako to za nanzhi a imani jin nan dan mini izhe nanao Yi maajina taimako fo nan erizhi gaku gikini nan

 The Day when no profit will it be to Wrong-doers to present their excuses but they will only have the Curse and the Home of Misery,Efo nan uzuri yan azwalumizhi a jina anfania nan laana yan Soko maajin tabbata ta etiabo emi azaba dede maajin tabbata yaa
 We did aforetime give Moses the Book of Guidance and We gave the book in inheritance to the Children of Israel-,Akika Yi la bawu ya Annabi Musa Yi cia litafi Attaura gi gun ya Bani Israilazhi
 A Guide and a Message to men of Understanding,Bawu uyio be sin santuy ya za nanzhi ga de hankali nan
Patiently then persevere for the Promise of Allah is true and ask forgiveness for thy fault and celebrate the Praises of thy Lord in the evening and in the morning,A hankuri jin akika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio Wyo mao wa gafara yan zunubi wyozhi wyo mao li Soko tsatsa yin fe jin yebo ya Tsoci wye to lozun to laazhin
Those who dispute about the signs of Allah without any authority bestowed on them- there is nothing in their breasts but the quest of greatness which they shall never attain to seek refuge then in Allah It is He Who hears and sees all things,Akika za nazhie gbomi dan aya Soko o nan U mayi be hujja ndoci nan be yaa naa nan yandondo fi yangbanazhi boa sai de eti kagbo a maa tso guriazhia Fe wa tswitswa be Sokoe akika Etsu nae wo gan nan uyio Etsu nae le ba ye nan uyio
 Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater matter than the creation of men Yet most men understand not,Wallahi jin jin yan sanmazhi to kin u wancin gan jin jin yan zawangizhi ammade ekundondo zawangizhi kpea
 Not equal are the blind and those who clearly see Nor are equal those who believe and work deeds of righteousness and those who do evil Little do ye learn by admonition!,Yebonci be za nae leba ye nan ajin yannia za nanzhi ga imani jin acie lotun guru nan a jin yanni be za dede yina Eza degi minie bo gae santuo
 The Hour will certainly come Therein is no doubt Yet most men believe not,Akika Alkiyami a dabe kelokezhin ndondo danboa ammade ekundondo zawangizhi a jin imania
And your Lord says Call on Me I will answer your Prayer but those who are too arrogant to serve Me will surely find themselves in Hell - in humiliation!,Tsoci ye ma gan Efe ba Mi yan Mia gwo aduwae akika za nanzhie gbotika be jin jin bautae ya Mi nan a ga gan fi jahannamao aci gafe eza gbigbacizhi
It is Allah Who has made the Night for you that ye may rest therein and the days as that which helps you to see Verily Allah is full of Grace and Bounty to men yet most men give no thanks,Soko ga la yeshi ya ye yeo ebo ye debae shi yangbane fi miniu bo to batin ebo ye fe le ba ye Akika Soko Etsu eryatwazhi uyio ya zawangizhi ammade ekundondo zawangizhie jin yeboaSurah Such is Allah your Lord the Creator of all things there is no god but He Then how ye are deluded away from the Truth!Soko ga dano nao wun ga yi Tsoci ye yeo wun ga jin alitta yan yandondo a de yan nan a jin bauta ya be gaskiyae naa sai wuny kiy be la acie la ye pan ke eko lugwao
 Thus are deluded those who are wont to reject the Signs of Allah,Acinga ga za nanzhie gbomi be aya Soko zhiy nan e la pan ke eko Soko lugwao Ebo emi gboazhio
It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a resting place and the sky as a canopy and has given you shape- and made your shapes beautiful- and has provided for you Sustenance of things pure and good- such is Allah your Lord So Glory to Allah the Lord of the Worlds!,Soko ga la kin cici ya ye ucia fe edunfe bao u cia sanmam tu gikini Ucia ye jin be tswitswa wangiy Ucia ye ya arziki wangizhi Soko ye ga dano nao Wunga yi Tsoci ye yeo Elatu yan baeni wunajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata nan
 He is the Living One There is no god but He Call upon Him giving Him sincere devotion Praise be to Allah Lord of the Worlds!,Etsu rayi uyio ade Etsu ndocia sai wuny efe jin bauta yau ye mae la yangbane tadzu dan jin jin adinio ebo ubo Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata nan
Say I have been forbidden to invoke those whom ye invoke besides Allah- seeing that the Clear Signs have come to me from my Lord and I have been commanded to bow in Islam to the Lord of the Worlds,Gan gan Akika Soko kan mi han min ga jin bauta ya yannazhiy ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa na ma Ebo nan bayanizhi da be ya mi yina ni dagan eba tsoci mi bo Soko ma jin mi foro gan min la kpatsun tanya Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpaata nan
It is He Who has created you from dust then from a sperm-drop then from a leech-like clot then does he get you out into the light as a child then lets you grow and reach your age of full strength then lets you become old- though of you there are some who die before- and lets you reach a Term appointed in order that ye may learn wisdom,Soko ga jin alitta ye dagan jikannan bo gancin dagan maniybo gancin ucia zhe egya tsuntsun ci gancin aci ga ye wa tinya dzakangiy gancin ye cia bea jin ba-ligi gancin yecia bea kuku mini yebo a de nanzhiy gaa tsu shidzo nan Ebo ye debae tun iyaka ndoci nan yi bibaci nan Ebo ye lae fe eza ankali zhi
 It is He Who gives Life and Death and when He decides upon an affair He says to it Be and it is,Soko gae dan eyan rayio u ga mae wu rayio umaga alamari ndondo kpa wun de ajinu ganu gan afe uci gaa fe
 Seest thou not those that dispute concerning the Signs of Allah How are they turned away from Reality-,Wyo le za nanzhie gbomi dan mini aya Soko zhio nan yea Kendoe e cea za naa
Those who reject the Book and the revelations with which We sent our messengers but soon shall they know-,Za nan zhia litafi Alkuranu yi ganmanan nan aci kezhea yan nanzhi yia tun Tucizhi tun nan yi ganmanan nan bele yin a be kpe
When the yokes shall be round their necks and the chains they shall be dragged along-,Kaminan agaku kuruzhi fia korozhio nan to dzamizhi acia fe gbaa da fi enano nan
When the yokes shall be round their necks and the chains they shall be dragged along-,Kaminan agaku kuruzhi fia korozhio nan to dzamizhi acia fe gbaa da fi enano nan
 In the boiling fetid fluid then in the Fire shall they be burned,A fi mini nuwan yipao a cia fi mini ena o nan a fe la dina nan
Then shall it be said to them Where are the deities to which ye gave part-worship-,Gancin acia gana gan Ba yannanzhi ye fe la pa Soko baci nan dano
In derogation of Allah They will reply They have left us in the lurch Nay we invoked not of old anything that had real existence Thus does Allah leave the Unbelievers to stray,Yecie wuna ke Soko lugwa Acia gan gan A gbin yi yeo Aa yi jin bauta ya yandondo lea niy Acinga ga Sokoe gbin kafirizhio
That was because ye were wont to rejoice on the earth in things other than the Truth and that ye were wont to be insolent,Wuncin ma a tswan ye tswan ebo fahri banza na ye fe jin kpe eti kinbo nao be etun banza nanzhi ye fe lo nao
 Enter ye the gates of Hell to dwell therein and evil is this abode of the arrogant!,E fe gandan eko yan jahannama zhio ba ga bo yea fi tutun yino akika zoba yan za nanzhie lati dan fino nan wuna biy
So persevere in patience for the Promise of Allah is true and whether We show thee in this life some part of what We promise them- or We take thy soul to Our Mercy before that-in any case it is to Us that they shall all return,A ankuri jin akika alkawali Soko gaskiya uyio U jin wo Yiga sashi yan alkawali azaba nan Yie jin kafirizhi nan laa wu wye U jin wo ma ajali wye u lau jin akika kpata akezhe dazhin eba Yi
We did aforetime send messengers before thee of them there are some whose story We have related to thee and some whose story We have not related to thee It was not possible for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of Allah but when the Command of Allah issued the matter was decided in truth and justice and there perished there and then those who stood on Falsehoods,Akika Yi tun Tucizhi tun shi wyo dzo miniabo ade nanzhi Yi ya wye labariazhi nan ama de nanzhi yi la labariazhi ya wyo yaa nan Akika U gwo yin ya Tuci ndondo nan wuna la aya ndoci be naa sai be izini Sokoe Kaminan alamari Soko gatula nan a ga hukunci jin tsakaniabo be gaskiyae kanga ma ganmanan Zuncizhi gajin asara
 It is Allah Who made cattle for you that ye may use some for riding and some for food,Soko ga la dabbazhi ya ye yeo ebo ye de etu miniabo miniabo ma ade nanzhi yea fe gi nan
 And there are other advantages in them for you besides that ye may through them attain to any need there may be in your hearts and on them and on ships ye are carried,Yema de eyan anfanizhi miniabo ebo ma ye dea ela-ewo bukata yan yangban yezhi Gancin eti dabba yezhio to eya nuwanzhi yea lo ebazhi wo be kara ye zhiy
And He shows you always His Signs then which of the Signs of Allah will ye deny,Soko mae la ayauzhi wu ye kici mini aya Soko zhio danbo nan yea gbomi nao
Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and in the traces they have left in the land Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them,Kashi e za za kpe eti kin boa kacina ngan a le kendoe zoba zanazhiy shiadzo nan yiyi nan ye Ngan za wuncinzhi dokun gana ama gboka gana ama de bazhi gana kpe kin bo Etun nanzhiy ma a lo kpata na u kunke yaa
For when their messengers came to them with Clear Signs they exulted in such knowledge and skill as they had but that very Wrath at which they were wont to scoff hemmed them in,Kaminan Tuciazhi be yaa be bayanizhiy nan a fe jin fahri be yannanzhiy fi bea yin mini kpikpeo nan Yannanzhiy afe laa la-mi nan cia jin tabbata ta etiabo
 But when they saw Our Punishment they said We believe in Allah- the one Allah - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him,Kaminan abe le azaba Yi ye nan a gan Yia imani jin be Sokoe gbaugi yi maajin kafirinci be yannanzhi yi fe laa pau baci nan
But their professing the Faith when they actually saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them Such has been Allah´s Way of dealing with His Servants from the most ancient times And even thus did the Rejecters of Allah perish utterly!,Kanga imania u jina anfania ebo nan azaba Yi gaa a le yeo Nan nan ekpa Soko uyio naa shidzo dan tacin wuzhiuzhio nan Kanga kafirizhi cia jin asaara

 Thus doth He send inspiration to thee as He did to those before thee- Allah Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom,Acinga ga Soko Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima wune jin wahayi be ya wyo yao to zanazhiy shi wyo dzo nao
 To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth and He is Most High Most Great,Wyun ga wun yannanzhiy fi sanmazhio to nanzhiy fi kin bo nao wun ga ma yi Etsu elatuo Etsu cinwano
The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them by Him Glory and the angels celebrate the Praises of their Lord and pray for forgiveness for all beings on earth Behold! Verily Allah is He the Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Sanmazhi atsotso ke a ga banfi dagan fitio nan ebo edo yan cinwan Soko Malaikazhi mae li Soko be ekundo yan yebo jiny ya Tsocia yin amae kezhe ba gaafara ya za nanzhiy fi kinbo nan Akika Soko ga yi Etsu gaafarao U ga ma yi Etsu yeguno
 And those who take as protectors others besides Him- Allah doth watch over them and thou art not the disposer of their affairs,Za nanzhiy ma a zandocizhi la ndakata ke Soko lugwa nan kpikpe yan Soko ta etiabo wyo ma jin za naa fe tswa etunazhi za naa
Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Qur´an that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her- and warn them of the Day of Assembly of which there is no doubt when some will be in the Garden and some in the Blazing Fire,Acinga ga Yi jin wahayi Alkuranu be ya wye yo u ma yi be ezhimi Larubawae ebo wyo yo jin jamaa yan Makacizhi gangba to za nanzhiy mau kezhe nan izhe kpata Wyo mao jina gangba eti efo gun-gun yekan wanciko kelo kezhin ndondo dan boa jamaa sashizhi a fi Aljannao jamaa sashizhi maa fi enan yan sairuo
 If Allah had so willed He could have made them a single people but He admits whom He will to His Mercy and the Wrong-doers will have no protector nor helper,Wuna ba Soko ba da uga zawangizhi laazhe alumma nini eti adini ninio ammade wune la za nan ga bau nan a gandan mini yegunu bo Azwalumizhi ma a de eyaa a ma de za naajina taimako naa
 What! Have they taken for worship protectors besides Him But it is Allah- He is the Protector and it is He Who gives life to the dead It is He Who has power over all things,Kashi a zandocizhi la la ndakatazhi zunma Soko Ngan Soko ga yi Ndakata yan gaskiyao wun ga maedan eyan tsutsu cizhi rayio U ma de kagbo ta eti yandondo
Whatever it be wherein ye differ the decision thereof is with Allah such is Allah my Lord In Him I trust and to Him I turn,Yandondo nan ma ye ga cedozhi leba etiubo nan Yea hukunci la aya Soko ebo nan wun ga wun hukunci kpatao Soko wuncin ga yi Tsoci mi yino wun ga mi ya kpeo ebau ga ma mia zheban loo
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth He has made for you pairs from among yourselves and pairs among cattle by this means does He multiply you there is nothing whatever like unto Him and He is the One that hears and sees all things,Soko ga yi Etsu nan jin alitta sanmazhi to kin nao Wuna yinzagizhi jin ya ye dagan mini nankan yetso to dabbazhiotso wunajin eba be yiwozhiy Wunejin alitta yezhi dokun fi mini eba be yiwo zhiy Akika ade yandoci dozhin Sokoa Etsu u ma yio nae wo gan nan Etsu nae le bandondo ye nan
To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth He enlarges and restricts The Sustenance to whom He will for He knows full well all things,Giyeko yan edzunba ko yan arziki yan sanmazhi to kin dan baubo wune kpe gwa arziki ya za nan ga baunan U mae la degi ya za nan ga bau nan Akika Soko de kpikpe yan yandondo
The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham Moses and Jesus Namely that ye should remain steadfast in religion and make no divisions therein to those who worship other things than Allah hard is the way to which thou callest them Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases and guides to Himself those who turn to Him,Sokoa sharia la cici ya ye yan adini iri nantso u lajin wahayi be ya Annabi Nuhu nan to nantso Yi jin wahayiu be ya wye nan to yan Ibrahima to Musa to Isa kpaataa Yi jina wasiyya gan Yea adini ku gikini Ye mae ga sakpazhi be dozhi dan mini adinio ma Yan nan wyoe la yi kafirizhi gan abea tsun nan wuna lukpin fia Soko ajin u tsa za nan ga bau nan zhin ekou U mae la za nan gazheban zhin ebau-nan ke eko gboro
And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them- through selfish envy as between themselves Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord tending to a Term appointed the matter would have been settled between them But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious disquieting doubt concerning it,A ma kpe ka-ka-yin be dozhi yina sai de baci nan kpikpe da be yaa zo nan ebo nanvo nandan tsakaniabo be dozhiy nan Kaujin ebo hukunci Tsoci naa shidzoa ni uci pata yaa da kandoci yegboro naa daaga hukunci ba tsakaniabo be dozhiy Akika za nanzhiy gigun yan Litafi zunmaabo nan ejin kelokezhin dan alamari adinio
Now then for that reason call them to the Faith and stand steadfast as thou art commanded nor follow thou their vain desires but say I believe in the Book which Allah has sent down and I am commanded to judge justly between you Allah is our Lord and your Lord for us is the responsibility for our deeds and for you for your deeds There is no contention between us and you Allah will bring us together and to Him is our Final Goal,Ebo acino fe yi zazhi zhin eko Soko Wyo mao laokuo gikini kendoe Soko jino foro nan ga lami tu etun yangbanazhi ma Gan gan mia gaskiya ya be Litafi nanzhi Soko cin beyin nan a ma jin mi foro gan min tswa adalci gboro da tsakani ye bo Soko ga yi Tsoci yi yio to yan ye yeo egagba yan etun yizhi yi ga wuno nyan ye tso ma ye ga wuno emigbo ndondo dan tsakani yi bo be ye yina Soko ga yi ku yekan baenio ebau gabo ma ezhekeba dano
 But those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted- futile is their dispute in the Sight of their Lord on them will be a Penalty terrible,Za nanzhiy mae gbomi eti alamari Soko nan baci nan ekundondo zawangizhi a imani jin beu yina ni nan hujja yan zawuncinzhi nyi-nyi ci uyio eba Tsociabo ewunzhe yan Soko maajin tabbata ta etiabo azaba nan tan sarauyin nan wunajin tabbata yaa
It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth and the Balance by which to weigh conduct And what will make thee realise that perhaps the Hour is close at hand,Soko ga yi Etsu nancin Litafi be be gaskiyae nao ganni be tsunwan yan gboro dae Kiy maala kpikpe ya wyo yo ko Alkiyami a tsoba kpan kpan yina nio
Only those wish to hasten it who believe not in it those who believe hold it in awe and know that it is the Truth Behold verily those that dispute concerning the Hour are far astray,Za nanzhiy a jin imani beu yina nan edin Alkiyami ye za nanzhiy ma imani jin beu yin nan e sundanu a ma kpe wo ke gaskiya uyio nan Akika za nanzhie jin kelo kezhin eti Alkiyamio nan a fi mini egbin naa kpe ya nan
 Gracious is Allah to His servants He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases and He has power and can carry out His Will,Soko Etsu yegun uyio be wuzhiuzhiy wyune la arziki ya za na ga bau nan Akika Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe Uyio
To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter We give increase in his tilth and to any that desires the tilth of this world We grant somewhat thereof but he has no share or lot in the Hereafter,Zandondo nae lo tun ucie wa egagba yan Alkiyami nan Yia beu bibe dan mini egagbaubo za nan ma gae lo tun ebo egagba izheo nan Yia yau miniubo u maa de rabo ndondo efo alkiyami yina
What! have they partners in godhead who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allah Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment the matter would have been decided between them at once But verily the Wrong-doers will have a grievous Penalty,Kashi a de Tsoci ndocizhi de baci Soko nan la sharia cici yaa yan adini natso ma Soko yaa izini wuna nan Akika kagan u jin ebo nan hukunci Soko a shidzoani naa da aga hukunci ba tsakaniabo tun dagan izhe babo Akika azaba nan tan nan wunajin tabbata ya azwalumizhi
 Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned and the burden of that must necessarily fall on them But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens they shall have before their Lord all that they wish for That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty of Allah,Wyoa le azwalumizhi ye a fe sundan yan egagba ded yan etun nanzhiy a lo nan U ma ga cin taa Zananzhi maa imani jin acie lotun guru nan a fi mini bata Aljannazhio yannanzhi a gae wa kpata nan u dan be Tsocia yin Nan nan ga yi daraja nan wancin nao
That is the Bounty whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds Say No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin And if any one earns any good We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Ready to appreciate service,Nan nan ga Sokoe la fa wuzhiuzhi yangbano nanzhia imani jin amae lotun wangizhi nan Gan gan Mi gbin ye gan egagba yan etun nan mie lo nan boa sai de cincin yan dangibo  nan dan tsakaniabo nan Zaeni ndondo nan ga lo tun wangi nan Yia beu bolobolo dan miniubo Akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu nan e jin yebo nan uyio
What! Do they say He has forged a falsehood against Allah But if Allah willed He could seal up thy heart And Allah blots out Vanity and proves the Truth by His Words For He knows well the secrets of all hearts,Kashiy e gan-agn ganmanan u zun ta Soko Ngan Wunaba Soko ba uga eyan te yangban wye Soko ma ga ganmana finya u ma ga gaskiya jin tabbata be hukunciuyin akika ude kpikpe yan yannazhi fi yangbanzhio nan
 He is the One that accepts repentance from His Servants and forgives sins and He knows all that ye do,U mae gwo gwatan tuba yan wuzhi u zhi U mae fa be etun dedezhiy U ma de kpikpe yan etun nazhiy ye lo na
 And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and gives them increase of His Bounty but for the Unbelievers their is a terrible Penalty,U mae gwo aduwa za nazhi ga imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi na U maa bea mini eryatwaubo Kafirizhi ma azaba tsuntsun gaajin tabbata yaa
If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth but he sends it down in due measure as He pleases For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted Watchful,Daaci gan Soka ariziki kpegwa kpe ya wuzhiuzhi baenio daaga gbotika kpe eti kinbo agagwo iyaka gan ammade Wyune cinu cin be gwargwado yan kendoe ga bau na Akika Soko de labari yan na wuzhi uzhi fiy ninbo na U mae cina le
 He is the One that sends down rain even after men have given up all hope and scatters His Mercy far and wide And He is the Protector Worthy of all Praise,Wyun ga mae du le be ya ao baci nan a ga kauna ba nao Umaela yegunu twarya yaa Akika Wun ga yi Ndakatao Etsu nan yandondo e jin yebo ya nan
And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living creatures that He has scattered through them and He has power to gather them together when He wills,U ma dan mini ayau zhio jinjin yan sanmazhi be kin yin to dabba nazhi ga fi bonan Uma de iko nan Ugakua yekan nan ka mina u ga bau nan
 Whatever misfortune happens to you is because on the things your hands have wrought and for many of them He grants forgiveness,Yandondo nama ga tswan ye mini yan masi-bazhio nan etun dede yan egwa ye tso zhi ga dinu beo U mae fa be etun dede nazhi dokun nan
 Nor can ye frustrate aught fleeing through the earth nor have ye besides Allah any one to protect or to help,Ye maa gangwa kin boa ye ma de Ndakata a gwo Soko gana ye ma de taimako jinci a gan wuna
And among His Signs are the ships smooth-running through the ocean tall as mountains,U dan mini a ya uzhio eya nuwan nazhie je kpe eti eduzhio nan wyoa le a ye ba kpako a yi ke patizhi nan
 If it be His Will He can still the Wind then would they become motionless on the back of the ocean Verily in this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful,U ga bau uga efe kan gikini eyazhi kpata ci gakan ta ta eti eduo Akika mini wuncino aya danbo ya zandondo na gae jin hakuri ucie jin yebo ya Soko nan
 Or He can cause them to perish because of the evil which the men have earned but much doth He forgive,Ko ma wuna jin hallaka ebo dede nazhi a lo nan U mae fa be nan dokun nae
 But let those know who dispute about Our Signs that there is for them no way of escape,Za nazhiy mae gbomi dan mini aya Yizhio na atso gakpe foga gan a de bandonbo nan a bici lo naa
Whatever ye are given here is but a convenience of this life but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting it is for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord,Akika yan dondo nan Soko ga la ya ye nan eman wo u yio teten-gi yan izhe natso dan be Sokoe nan ude alhei gan u ma fedun gan ya za nanzhiy ga imani jin amaa yakpe Tsocia nan
Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds and when they are angry even then forgive,To za nanzhi e kpe ya be zunubi wancikozhiy to etun sakpazhiy nan a maga a jin fushi ajin a fa nan
Those who hearken to their Lord and establish regular Prayer who conduct their affairs by mutual Consultation who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance,To za nazhi e ye yiyi yan Tsocianan a mae kursalla gikini nan alamariazhi ma eti shawara bo ejin wuno nan a maekezhe wu dukiya-zhi fi eko wangio mini arziki nanzhi Yi la yaa nan
And those who when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them are not cowed but help and defend themselves,To za nazhiy zwalunci ga tswana a jina wa taimako eti jin jin gao nan 
The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto in degree but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation his reward is due from Allah for Allah loveth not those who do wrong,Egagba yan etun dede ma dede iri dozhinu Za nan ma gabea fa nan uci jin bolobolo nan ladau dan eba Soko akika Sokoe wa azwalumizhia
 But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong done to them against such there is no cause of blame,Zanan ma gaa jin ga baci nan u jin zwalunci nan zawuncinzhi lefi ndondota etia boa
 The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land defying right and justice for such there will be a penalty grievous,Akika lefi ta eti za nazhie jin zawangizhi zw-alunci nao a cie gwo iyaaka gan kpe eti kinbo umajin eti gaskiya boa nan Akika za wuncinzhi azaba nan tan wuncinzhi tabbata yaa
 But indeed if any show patience and forgive that would truly be an exercise of courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs,Za nan ma ga ankuri jin u ci fa nan akika wuncin dan mini alamari nan zhiy gbota nao
For any whom Allah leaves astray there is no protector thereafter And thou wilt see the Wrong-doers when in sight of the Penalty Say Is there any way to effect a return,Zaeni ndondo na Soko ga u gbin nan wunade ndakata ndoci zunmau boa wyo maale azwalumizhi ye kami nan aga le azaba ye nan acia fe gan gan Ngba yi ade kafa ndoci be nan yi gazheban da izhe naa
 And thou wilt see them brought forward to the Penalty in a humble frame of mind because of their disgrace and looking with a stealthy glance And the Believers will say Those are indeed in loss who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment Behold! Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Penalty!,Wyo maa lea ye afekua tu yi kpe eti enao aci gaa gba a gasunzunye a fe yi ba yi cinle Za nazhiy a imani jin nan ci ganAkika eza asarazhiy aga yi za nanzhiy ajin asara yan etitacinazhio to yan iyaliazhi efo Alkiyami nao Akika azwalumizhi a fi mini azaba naa kugikini nao
And no protectors have they to help them other than Allah And for any whom Allah leaves to stray there is no way to the Goal,Amaa de ndakatazhi nazhia jina taimako baci Soko naa Akika zandondo nan Soko ga u gbin nan Wuna ke eko bea
 Hearken ye to your Lord before there come a Day which there will be no putting back because of the Ordainment of Allah! that Day there will be for you no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial of your sins!,Efe ye yiyi yan Tsoci ye shidzo kafi efo nan wuna ye dagwa yaa nan u be dagan eba Soko na Yea de eswoba ndodo fo wuncina a maade zandondo nana gbo mi naa
If then they run away We have not sent thee as a guard over them Thy duty is but to convey the Message And truly when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Ourselves he doth exult thereat but when some ill happens to him on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth truly then is man ungrateful!,Gancin a ga zunma zheta Yi tunwyo fia gan wyo yo feo tswaao zaa Yan wyo de u ga yi eyan wuo Kami nan Yi ga yegun yi laa ya zawangi degi na wunafe jin alfahri beu Yin kamina ma eyan dede gaa tswana ebo etun dede azhio nan akika kanga zawangi ga cin mannabo be Sokoe
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth He creates what He wills and plans He bestows children male or female according to His Will and Plan,Mulki yan sanmazhi to kin Soko wuno Wunejin yan na ga bau nan Wune twarya ynzagizhi ya za nan ga bau nan U mea twarya bagizhi ya za nan ga bau nan
 Or He bestows both males and females and He leaves barren whom He will for He is full of Knowledge and Power,Ko ma wuna zhin keba bagizhi to ynzagizhi za nan ma ga bau nan wunu ya raama gbasanyn wuna degi ndondo maa akika Etsu kpikpe u yio Etsu iko
 It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration or from behind a veil or by the sending of a messenger to reveal with Allah´s permission what Allah wills for He is Most High Most Wise,U ma gwo Yin na a gan gan Soko gan gan be alita ndondoe naa eye be eye saide be wahayiy ko ma zunmata yan yekan ndocio ko ma wuna tun Tuci tun ucia jin wahayi yau be iziniu yin yan yannan ga bau na akika Etsu elatu u yio Egba u yio
And thus have We by Our Command sent inspiration to thee thou knewest not before what was Revelation and what was Faith but We have made the Qur´an a Light wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will and verily thou dost guide men to the Straight Way-,Acinga ga Yijin wahayi be ya wye yan Alkuranu dagan foro yi bo zunma ba tsozhio wyo de kpikpe Litafia wyo ma kpe Imani yea ammade Yi u laafe haske Yie lajin zanan ga ba yi na shiri mini wuzhi yi zhio Akika ma Wyoe wu zazhi ba lo eko nantso yi gboro nan

By the Book that makes things clear-,Mie zhi kuti be Alkuranuy Litafi nan yi be bayanizhiy naa tula nan
 We have made it a Qur´an in Arabic that ye may be able to understand and learn wisdom,Akika Yiu la afe Alkuranu be zhimi larubawazhiy ebo ye laefe eza ankalizhi
 We have made it a Qur´an in Arabic that ye may be able to understand and learn wisdom,Akika Yiu la afe Alkuranu be zhimi larubawazhiy ebo ye laefe eza ankalizhi
And verily it is in the Mother of the Book in Our Presence high in dignity full of wisdom,Akika Alkuranu dan mini Nna yan Litafizhio lauhul-Mahfuz eba Yi bo ma Alkuranu litafi na latu nan uyio naa she be hikimae nan
Shall We then take away the Message from you and repel you for that ye are a people transgressing beyond bounds,Kashiy Yi ga cin cin be yan sinsantu lugwaa baenio ebo nan ye yeafe za nanzhie nyin yan kpe kin bo nan
 But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old,Eka nan dokun nan Yi tun Annabi fi jamaa yan mafarizhi
 And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him,A ma de Annabi ndondo nan be yaa naa sai de afe lau mi
 So We destroyed them- stronger in power than these- and thus has passed on the Parable of the peoples of old,Yimaa za nazhiy gboka gana nan jin hallaka iri azaba nan tswan za mafarizhi na cia da eti atso gwo gan
If thou wert to question them ´Who created the heavens and the earth´ They would be sure to reply ´they were created by Him the Exalted in Power Full of Knowledge´-,Wallahi wyo ga gbina gan gan Ziy jin alitta sanmazhi to kin yino Akika ayazhe gan Soko Etsu zankpe Etsu kpikpe ga jin alittaao
Yea the same that has made for you the earth like a carpet spread out and has made for you roads and channels therein in order that ye may find guidance on the way,Etsu naa kin ta cici ya ye parae nan U cia ekozhi sa fi bo ya ye nan Ebo ye debae laede bawu nan
 That sends down from time to time rain from the sky in due measure- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead even so will ye be raised from the dead-,Etsu nae du ele zhin dagan sanmao be tsunwane nan Yicia ezhi tsutsucizhi dan rayi beu yin A cin ga ga a ku ye tso tinya dagan kabariezhi bo
 That has created pairs in all things and has made for you ships and cattle on which ye ride,Etsu nan jin alitta eba be yiwozhiy kpata nan U ci kezhe jin eya nuwanzhi nan yeade ganfi nan to dabbazhiy nanzhiy yede tu nan
In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs and when so seated ye may celebrate the kind favour of your Lord and say Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our use for we could never have accomplished this by ourselves,Ebo ye debae lae fedunekpe zunmaabo yemae fe pa niimayan Tsoci yezhi kami nan ye gaa fe dun ta etiabo nan ye mae gan ganLili kpata ajin tabbata ya Etsu naa e yan tuci nan nan jin foro ya yi nan akika yi de kagbo ndondo ta eti ezan daa boa
 And to our Lord surely must we turn back!Akika kpata yi ma eba Tsoci yi ga yia kezhe lo,
 Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him in his godhead! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed!,Acia za ndoci tsa yau mini wuzhiu zhio ke wun ga yi egi wuno nan akika zawangi eza uyio nae cin manan bo be Sokoenan manan cinbo naa tula nan
What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates and granted to you sons for choice,Ngba wuna egi ynzagizhi tsa mini alittauzhio U cia ye tsa be egi bagizhiy
 When news is brought to one of them of the birth of what he sets up as a likeness to Allah Most Gracious his face darkens and he is filled with inward grief!,A ma ga ya zaeni miniabo labari yangban fa be egi ynzagiy nane da gan gan Soko Al-Rahmanu tsa gan Na fuska u gashi zhiko yangbanu ci ganyin
Is then one brought up among trinkets and unable to give a clear account in a dispute to be associated with Allah,Ngba ye ga dangi tsa ya Soko Be za nae sa sa dan mini ninpao nan za nan man ka wunabe ewun sunzhi wuna kpe gan ri woa nan
And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah Did they witness their creation Their evidence will be recorded and they will be called to account!,Acia Malaikazhi nazhiy yi wuzhi Soko na la ynzagizhi Beke a jin ri jinka mi nan a jin alittaa nan A kika a ga eri azhi ka a-maa gbina gan efo Alkiyamiy
 Ah! they say If it had been the will of Allah Most Gracious we should not have worshipped such deities! Of that they have no knowledge! they do nothing but lie!,Aci gan Wuna ba Soko Al-Rahmanu ba ngan yi yaajin bauta ya Malaikazhia Ade kpikpe ndoci eti wuncin boa akika a detswa ganmana tswa kawanyin
What! have We given them a Book before this to which they are holding fast,Kashiy Yi la Litafi ndoci laa yaa shi Alkuranu dzo Wuncin ci la a egwa sunu gbanyin
Nay! they say We found our fathers following a certain religion and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps,Ade gan Akika yi tsun yanmanci yizhi kpe eti izhe le iri ndocio etaazhi ga ma yi ga emi tuo
Just in the same way whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people the wealthy ones among them said We found our fathers following a certain religion and we will certainly follow in their footsteps,Acinga ga u ma yio Yi laa tun gangba jin ci tun dan ezhi ndocio shi wyo dzo lea sai de bagwo deciazhi agan gan Yi de tsun yanmanci yizhi tsun ta eti eko izhe le ndocio Yi ma etaazhi ga ga emi tuo
He said What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following They said For us we deny that ye prophets are sent on a mission at all,Gan gan Asa bawu nan mi la be nan U gye gan natso ye tsun yanmanci yezhi kpe tiubo naa A gan Yi de ajin kafirinci be yan nan a tun yetun nae
So We exacted retribution from them now see what was the end of those who rejected Truth!,Yicia wo gbata Cin kendoe zoba yan ganmanan zuncizhiy nan le
 Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship,Kami na Annabi Ibrahima gan be Babau yin to Jamaa yanu zhi nanjin bauta yanan
I worship only Him Who made me and He will certainly guide me,Sai de za nan jin alitta mi nan akika Wun ga wu mi bao
 And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him that they may turn back to Allah,Uciu fe egan wanciko naa danubo fe lo mini zuriyau zhio na ebo zawangizhi a daazhin eko yan gaskiya
Yea I have given the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the Truth has come to them and a messenger making things clear,Aa Mi dea za nananzhiy to yanmanciazhi ya fi izheo fe wo ma har be lokaci nan gaskiya Alkuranu be yaa nan ganni be Tuciy naa tula nan
But when the Truth came to them they said This is sorcery and we do reject it,Kamina gaskiya Alkuranu be yaa nan a gan nan nan eyan ma uyio yimaa kafirinci jin beu yin
Also they say Why is not this Qur´an sent down to some leading man in either of the two chief cities,A ci gan Kiy la aci cin Alkuranu nan nan be ya bagi ko ndoci mini Alkarya guba nazhiy wancin nan boa yino
Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world and We raise some of them above others in ranks so that some may command work from others But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the wealth which they amass,Kashi a gae gan eryatwa yan Tsoci wyo yo Ngan Yi gae gan Arzikiazhi ya izhe bo Yi maa daraja yan sashiazhi laata eti yan sashio ebo adeba la dozhi etun yegun yan Tsoci wyo ma ude alheri gan eyan izhe nanzhiy e ku ye kan nan
And were it not that all men might become of one evil way of life We would provide for everyone that blasphemes against Allah Most Gracious silver roofs for their houses and silver stair-ways on which to go up,KaUjin ebo nan zawangizhi a bea zhea yan ni na boa eba fitina eyande izheo naa da yi ga katanti yan emi kafirizhi laafe azurfa to ekpa nanzhiy a fe da lo kata fiti nan
And silver doors to their houses and thrones of silver on which they could recline,Yi maa kezhea kpako yan emiazhi to gadoazhi jin be azurfae nan a fe de kpetso ta nan
And also adornments of gold But all this were nothing but conveniences of the present life The Hereafter in the sight of thy Lord is for the Righteous,To kaya ninpazhi kpata wuncinzhi ma eyan emawo izhe ayio akika ma emi yan zoba wangi wunajin tabbata ya za nanzhie tswa Soko nan
 If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of Allah Most Gracious We appoint for him an evil one to be an intimate companion to him,Zandondo nan gae le izhe ke pipa Soko lugwa nan Yi ga shaitan laa pa ma beu yin Uci gaazhe eya manciu
Such evil ones really hinder them from the Path but they think that they are being guided aright!Akika ma shaitanzhi gaa kan eko guruzhi yinda acia fe le ye ke eko bawu bo a kpeo nan,
At length when such a one comes to Us he says to his evil companion Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West! Ah! evil is the companion indeed!,Har da lokaci nan zagubaaba a be be eba Yi nan za wuncin cia gan gan Kasa re da aci gan kpikpe-ya dan tsakanimi bo be wyo yin ke tsakani eyi lazhin be eyilozuny nan wuna ba mi gan akika eya dede wyo yio

 Canst thou then make the deaf to hear or give direction to the blind or to such as wander in manifest error,Ngba wyo la tukpa tenci wo gan wo Kashi wyo la ye bonci leba ye wo To za nan gaafe dan mini egbin nan a tula nan ngba wyo lau ke eko wo

 Even if We take thee away We shall be sure to exact retribution from them,Uma ga bea fe gan Yia rayi wye gwo akika Yigaa wogbata
Or We shall show thee that accomplished which We have promised them for verily We shall prevail over them,Ko ma Yi ga azaba nan Yie jina alkawali nan laa wu wye akika yi de kagbo eti yandondo
So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee verily thou art on a Straight Way,A gwa sun wahyi nantso Yi la ya wyo nan akika wyo ta eti eko gboro
The Qur´an is indeed the message for thee and for thy people and soon shall ye all be brought to accountAkika ma Alkuranu cinwan uyio ya wye to jamaa yan wyo zhi bele yin ma a gbine gan eti tswitswa yan hakkiuzhio,

 We did send Moses aforetime with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his Chiefs He said I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds,Akika Yi tun Musa tun be aya Yizhi lo eba Firauna be jamaa yanu zhiy Uci gan Akika mi Tuci mi yio dagan eba Tsoci nae kpa alittazhi kpata nao
We showed them Sign after Sign each greater than its fellow and We seized them with Punishment in order that they might turn to Us,Yi mae la aya wuaa sai de nan ga lekpan gan yan payin nan Yi cia wan be azabae ebo a debaa dazhin eko
 And they said O thou sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord for us according to His covenant with thee for we shall truly accept guidance,Aci gan Ya wye eyan manci ba aduwa be Tsoci wyo yin U to bo wahyi nan ujin ya wye naoula azaba ulau keuya bou ya yi akika yi gake eko
 But when We removed the Penalty from them behold they broke their word,Kamina Yi bea azaba la ke yabo yaa nan afelo alkawali ya
 And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people saying O my people! Does not the dominion of Egypt belong to me witness these streams flowing underneath my palace What! see ye not then,Firauna ci ya mi dan tacin jamaa yanuzhio u gan Ya ye jamaa yan mizhi ngba ujni mi ga wun mulki yan Misraa to edu nanzhie je dan tako mi bo naa Kashi ye leba ye lea
Am I not better than this Moses who is a contemptible wretch and can scarcely express himself clearly,Kashi mi gye gan eza gba gbangi nan naa zanan kaa bayani u jin woa naa
 Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him or why come not with him angels accompanying him in procession,Kiiyla aci cin dukiya yan zinariyazhi ya wuna yino Kiy ma la malaikazhi la mi tuu zunma boa yino
Thus did he make fools of his people and they obeyed him truly were they a people rebellious against Allah,Uci dzo dzo be ankali yan jamaa yanuzhi a tso cia mi tuu akika a fe jamaa nanzhiy a tula be lefi Sokoe nan
When at length they provoked Us We exacted retribution from them and We drowned them all,Lokaci nan abea yi ku tso nan Yicia wan be azabae Yicia jin hallaka fi nuwano bae nioSurah  And We made them a people of the Past and an Example to later agesYi cia la fe etanzhi nanzhia shidzo nan a mafe misali ya eza zunmazhi
When Jesus the son of Mary is held up as an example behold thy people raise a clamour thereat in ridicule!,Kami nan ajin misali yabe Isae egi Maryamae nan Kanga jama yan wyozhi cia pan ya ke eko lugwa
 And they say Are our gods best or he This they set forth to thee only by way of disputation yea they are a contentious people,Aci gan Ngba kuti yizhi tsa gano kashi Isa E  la misali la be ebo emigbo akika jamaazhi ayio nanzhiy ye bo ewu-sun nan
He was no more than a servant We granted Our favour to him and We made him an example to the Children of Israel,Isa de U fea sai de wuzhi nan yi twarya niima ya nan Yiciu laa fe misali ya Banu Israilazhi
And if it were Our Will We could make angels from amongst you succeeding each other on the earth,U ma ga bayi ba da yi ga Malaikazhi laa san ye gwa aci ga she bandondo mini kin bo

Let not the Evil One hinder you for he is to you an enemy avowed,Ye mae ga lugwa shaitan tso tangi ya ye ma akika makiri ye uyio yan gbangba
When Jesus came with Clear Signs he said Now have I come to you with Wisdom and in order to make clear to you some of the points on which ye dispute therefore fear Allah and obey me,Kaminan Isa be beya be bayanizhiy nan U gan Akika mi be ya ye be hikimae ebo ma min jin bayanin ya ye eti yan nanzhiy ye ce dozhi leba etiubo nan Ye de sundan Soko ye mae la mie tu mi

Do they only wait for the Hour - that it should come on them all of a sudden while they perceive not,Kashi a zhi bo zhi e tuye nan alkiyamia be dzun fia kamina a kpa yetua nan
Friends on that day will be foes one to another- except the Righteous,Ekun dondo masoyizhi fo wuncin agaazhe makiri dozhi sai de masoyi nan zhie tswa Soko nan

Such will be the Garden of which ye are made heirs for your good deeds in life,Aljanna wuncin a giu gun gi ya ye ebo iri etun wangizhi nanzhi ye fe lo nao

 The sinners will be in the Punishment of Hell to dwell therein for aye,Akika le fi jinci zhi a fi mini azaba jahannamao tutun yin
Nowise will the Punishment be lightened for them and in despair will they be there overwhelmed,Ato gban ya yan azabaa a maa kara dzun tinya boa
Nowise shall We be unjust to them but it is they who have been unjust themselves,Yi man jina zwaluncia akika atso tsa yi za nanzhiy jin eti tacina zwalunci nao
 They will cry O Malik! would that thy Lord put an end to us! He will say Nay but ye shall abide!,Acia yi kabara gan Gan ya Tsoci wye u la yi yiu wu gancin Ucia gana gan Akika ye ba ga bo yea fi tutun yino
Verily We have brought the Truth to you but most of you have a hatred for Truth,Akika Yi be ya ye be gaskiyae Kami nan ye fi izheo nan ammade ekun dondo ye zhi ye na gaskiya vo

 So leave them to babble and play with vanities until they meet that Day of theirs which they have been promised,Alugwaa a fea dzo bazhia za a maa fea dzodzo a za har da lokaci nan a be gun be efo nan Soko ajina alkawali nae
It is He Who is Allah in heaven and Allah on earth and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge,Wun ga yi Soko dan mini sanmazhi bo Wunga ma yi Soko dan kin bo Etsu hikima uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio
 And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all between them with Him is the Knowledge of the Hour of Judgment and to Him shall ye be brought back,Elatu wunajin tabbata ya Etsu nan wun mulki yan sanmazhi to kin nan to yannazhi fi tsakaniabo nan Kpikpe yan alkiyami mabeu yin Udano kpatae ma ebau ga yea kezhe lo
And those whom they invoke besides Allah have no power of intercession- only he who bears witness to the Truth and they know him,Za nan zhiymae jin bauta ya baciu bo nan a de mulki yan egwa tan zandondoa sai de za nanzhi ga jin ri be adini gaskiyae nan a ma yi be kpikpe nan
 If thou ask them who created them they will certainly say Allah How then are they deluded away from the Truth,Wallahi wyo ma ga gbinagan gan Ngba ziy jin alitta ye yeo A gan gan Soko to beibo e kan yangban zhi lo beo

Yet they turn away from him and say Tutored by others a man possessed!Adea zunma zhetau aci gan egi makanta uyio Uma ke yi ilanduci,

 There is nothing beyond our first death and we shall not be raised again,Yandondo danboa tsutsu de zunni uyio a maa ku yi yekan alkiyami boa
Then bring back our forefathers if what ye say is true!,Wunayi gaskiya ga yetao eku yamanci yizhi tinya dagan kabariazhio yi le ye

 We created not the heavens the earth and all between them merely in idle sport,Yi ma jin sanmazhi to kin to yan nanzhi fi tsakaniabo nan ebo edzo boa
 We created them not except for just ends but most of them do not understand,Yi jina jina sai de ebo Yi tso gaskiya ammade ekun dondo zawangizhi a kpea
 Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them-,Akika efo hukunci ba uga yi lokacia baeni bo
The Day when no protector can avail his client in aught and no help can they receive,Efo nan eya wuna kunke be yandondoe ya eya wuna nan amaa jin dozhi taimako woa

 The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom,Cin cin yan Litafi nan nan dagan eba Soko bo u fe beo Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima
Verily in the heavens and the earth are Signs for those who believe,Akika mini sanmazhio to kin ayazhi danbo ya Muminizhi
And in the creation of yourselves and the fact that animals are scattered through the earth are Signs for those of assured Faith,To mini alitta ye zhio to mini dabba nanzhiy ga kpe kinbo nan ayazhi danbo ya jamaa nanzhia gaskiya ya nan
 And in the alternation of Night and Day and the fact that Allah sends down Sustenance from the sky and revives therewith the earth after its death and in the change of the winds- are Signs for those that are wise,To egwasan yan yeshi be batiny to arziki nanzhiy Soko cin beyn dagan sanmao nan Ucia kin tsutsuci dan rayi nan to mini efe nae ti ucie je za nan kpata ayazhi danbo ya jamaa nanzhi ga yi be ankaliy nan
Such are the Signs of Allah which We rehearse to thee in Truth then in what exposition will they believe after rejecting Allah and His Signs,Wuncinzhi kpata ayazhi ayio yan Soko Yi mae gbaagba ya wye be gaskiyae Ngba zunma yan Soko be ayauzhiy ka gan ye ya gaskiya bea yina egan kici a ya gaskiya be yin beo
Woe to each sinful dealer in Falsehoods,Azaba yan robonkpe wunajin tabbata ya zaeni ndondo na gae zun ganmanan tsuru nan u ma yi lefi jinci nan
 He hears the Signs of Allah rehearsed to him yet is obstinate and lofty as if he had not heard them then announce to him a Penalty Grievous!,Wune wo nae gba aya Soko zhi yau nan gancin uci ga tu-ta eti etikagbo ufe jin bojin ke zanae wo gana nan e yau labari be azabae nan yi tintanci nan
And when he learns something of Our Signs he takes them in jest for such there will be a humiliating Penalty,Uma ga kpikpe ndoci de dagan mini aya Yizhio wunu la eyan edzo akika zawuncinzhi azaba yan zunyesun u gajin tabbata yaa
In front of them is Hell and of no profit to them is anything they may have earned nor any protectors they may have taken to themselves besides Allah for them is a tremendous Penalty,Enan yan jahannama danbo e kaa yan nanzhiy ma a de kuyekan izheo nan wuna kunke yaa eko ndondo boa to zandocizhi nanzhiy a la egwasun ke ndakatazhi nan a kunke ya eko ndondo boa azaba na ma wancin nan wunajin tabbata yaa
This is true Guidance and for those who reject the Signs of their Lord is a grievous Penalty of abomination,Alkuranu Nan nan bawu uyio za nanzhiy ma ajin kafirinci be aya Tsocia zhiy nan azaba nan de nangban uma tan nan wunajin tabbata yaa
 It is Allah Who has subjected the sea to you that ships may sail through it by His command that ye may seek of his Bounty and that ye may be grateful,Soko ga yi Etsu nan jin eduzhi foro ya yeo nao ebo eya nuwanzhi a fea dazanata etiubo be kagbo yan Sokoe ebo ma ye fe wa arziki yan Sokoe za be wunciny ma ye lae fe za nanzhie jin yebo ya Soko nan

 And He has subjected to you as from Him all that is in the heavens and on earth Behold in that are Signs indeed for those who reflect,U maa yannanzhiy fi sanmazhio nan to nan zhiy fi kinbo nan jin foro ya ye baenio dagan nko u bo akika mini wuncinzhio ayazhi danbo ya za nanzhiy gae kpaye nan
 Tell those who believe to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of Allah It is for Him to recompense for good or ill each People according to what they have earned,Gan ya za nanzhia imani jin nan gan afa be za nanzhiy e jin kauna yan egagba wangi dan efo yan Soko zhi boa nan Ebo nan Soko ga zawangizhi wo gbata be iri etun nanzhiy a ga lo nan
 If any one does a righteous deed it ensures to the benefit of his own soul if he does evil it works against his own soul In the end will ye all be brought back to your Lord,Za nan ga lo etun wangi nan ebo tiu bo za na ma ga lo tun dede nan wuntso ga wuna wu yan yao gancin eba Tsoci ye ga yea kezhe lo
 We did aforetime grant to the Children of Israel the Book the Power of Command and Prophethood We gave them for Sustenance things good and pure and We favoured them above the nations,Akika Yi ya Litafi to hukunci to Annabci laa ya Banu Israilazhi Yi ma yaa arziki wangizhi Yi maa ya daraja ta eti alittazhio
And We granted them Clear Signs in affairs of Religion it was only after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms through insolent envy among themselves Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment as to those matters in which they set up differences,Yi ma la hujjazhi be yaa nanzhia tula nan eti alamari adinio Ama ce dozhi lebaa sai de baci nan kpikpe da be yaa nan ebo nanvo hassada nan dan tsakaniabo be dozhiy nan Akika Tsoci wye ga hukunci ba tsakaniabo efo alkiyamiy eti yan nanzhie la ce le ba be dozhiy nan
 Then We put thee on the right Way of Religion so follow thou that Way and follow not the desires of those who know not,Gancin Yicia wyo laa ta eti ekp yan sharia yan alamari adinio ebo acino ami tuu wyo mao ga la mi tu etun yangban yan za nanzhi de kpikpea na ma
They will be of no use to thee in the sight of Allah it is only Wrong-doers that stand as protectors one to another but Allah is the Protector of the Righteous,Akika a kunke ya wye wo be yandondoe naa be dagan eba Soko naa akika ma azwalumizhi masoyizhi ayi be dozhi yino Soko ga ma yi Ndakata yan za nanzhie sundanu nao
These are clear evidences to men and a Guidance and Mercy to those of assured Faith,Alkuranu nan nan hujjazhi uyi ya zawangizhio ganni be bawuy be yeguny ya jamaa nanzhia gaskiya ya nao
What! Do those who seek after evil ways think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous deeds- that equal will be their life and their death Ill is the judgment that they make,Kashi za nanzhie lo tun dede nan e kpayekpa gan Yi laa ya afe yeni be za nanzhia imani jin amae lo tun guru nan a laazhe yeni to eba edunfe izheo be eba ajaliy Wunayi acinga ga e kpa yeo akika hukunci wuncin wuna biye
Allah created the heavens and the earth for just ends and in order that each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned and none of them be wronged,Soko ma alitta yan sanmazhi to kin jin be gaskiyae Ebo ma aga zandondo gba be iri etun nan u ga lo nae amaa jina zwaluncia
 Then seest thou such a one as takes as his god his own vain desire Allah has knowing him as such left him astray and sealed his hearing and his heart and understanding and put a cover on his sight Who then will guide him after Allah has withdrawn Guidance Will ye not then receive admonition,Ngba wyo le za naa etun yangbanu la tsociunan yea Soko ciu gbin eti kpikpeo U ciu tukpa to yangbanute Ucia kpere laa kpeu ba ye leu bo Ngba ziya wu za nan nan ba wo baci Soko bo Kashi ye kpa ye kpaa
And they say What is there but our life in this world We shall die and we live and nothing but time can destroy us But of that they have no knowledge they merely conjecture,Aci gan yandondo danboa izhe le tsau yio yi gaatsu yi ma gaa ye rayi de yandondo maajin-yi hallaka sai de zamam Ade kpikpe yan akika eti wuncin boa ama de yan nan e jin naa sai de zato
And when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them their argument is nothing but this They say Bring back our forefathers if what ye say is true!,Kamina ma a gae gba aya yi zhi yaa be bayaniy nan e de hujja ndondoa sai de a gan gan E la yanmanci yizhi nanzhia tsuani na be yi lea ye wunayi gaskiya ye tao nan
Say It is Allah Who gives you life then gives you death then He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt But most men do not understand,Gan gan Soko gae dan rayi umaa kezhe a ye wu gancin uci gae ku yekan efo alkiyamiy kelo kezhin ndondo danboa ammade ekun dondo zawangizhi akpea
 To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and the Day that the Hour of Judgment is established- that Day will the dealers in Falsehood perish!,Akika Soko ga wun mulki yan sanmazhi to kin bo efo nan alkiyami gaa nan nan fo wuncin ganmana zuncizhi gaajin asara
 And thou wilt see every sect bowing the knee Every sect will be called to its Record This Day shall ye be recompensed for all that ye did!,Wyo maale alumma ndondo ye ci kurao ta eti vokpaa bo Acia yi alumma ndondo lo eba Litafiu Yinnannnan aaga ye gba yan etun nanzhiy ye fe lo izheo nan
This Our Record speaks about you with truth For We were wont to put on Record all that ye did,Nan nan Litafi Yi uyio wune gan gan eti yebo be gaskiyae akika Yi yaafe yi fe ka etun nanzhiy ye fe lo nan
Then as to those who believed and did righteous deeds their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see,Ammade za nanzhi ga imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi nan Tsocia gaala gandan mini yegunu bo wuncin ga yi rabo nan latu nao
 But as to those who rejected Allah to them will be said Were not Our Signs rehearsed to you But ye were arrogant and were a people given to sin!,Za nanzhiy ma ajin kafirinci nan a gana gan Asa afe gba aya Mizhi ya ye yea Ye cia gbotika ye cia fe za nanzhie jin lefi kpe kinbo nan
And when it was said that the promise of Allah was true and that the Hour- there was no doubt about its coming ye used to say ´We know not what is the hour we only think it is an idea and we have no firm assurance´,A ma ga gana gan Akika alkawali yan Soko gaskiya uyio alkiyami ma kelo kezhin ndondo danboa Ye gan Yi kpe yan naotso e ye alkiyami naa yi de ejin zatto jin kawanyin yi ya gaskiya beu yina
 Then will appear to them the evil fruits of what they did and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!,Egagba yan etun dede nanzhiy a lo nan cia tula yaa yannan a fe la a lami nan cia jin tabbata ta etiabo
It will also be said This Day We will forget you as ye forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! and your abode is the Fire and no helpers have ye!,Aci a gana gan Yinnan nan nan Yi ga ye batan kendoe ye tsoa efo gun-gun yan ye be efo alkiyami nan batan nan ezhe kebae ma u ga yi enao ye maade za nanzhia jine taimako naa
 This because ye used to take the Signs of Allah in jest and the life of the world deceived you From that Day therefore they shall not be taken out thence nor shall they be received into Grace,Wuncin mayi ebo nan ye yaa aya Soko zhi la edzo nan edunfe yan izhe cia ye ta yinnannnan a kua tinya enan boa amma lugwa ade uzuri ndondo taa

 We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents In pain did his mother bear him and in pain did she give him birth The carrying of the child to his weaning is a period of thirty months At length when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years he says O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favour which Thou has bestowed upon me and upon both my parents and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve and be gracious to me in my issue Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow to Thee in Islam,Yi jin zawangi gangba gan wunutswa yan manciu zhi gubaba U mau do kun be jin jin yan bolobolo gan ni be a yin Ebo nan NnaU lau gun ewanu bo be wahalae U ci ke zheu man ganni be wahalae To ewan to kpikpa nan Nnau kpa U-nan U yi etswa gbanwo Her da lokaci nan U ga zhe gbarufu nan har da lokaci nan u ga gun gi ya shi-ba na U gan Tsoci jin mi foro ebo minlan fe za na e jin yebo yan manan manan na zhi wyo jin ya minan to nan zhi wyo jin ya yanmanci Mi zhi nan Mi ma n lanfe za na e lo tun wangi zhi nazhiwyoa jin yeda be yin na Wyo maojin bolo ya mi mini zuriya mi zhio Akika Mi a tubajin mi maa fe dan mini za na zhi e ta kpatsun -- foro wyo nao

Why then was no help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped as gods besides Allah as a means of access to Allah Nay they left them in the lurch but that was their falsehood and their invention,Kiy la za nan zhiy a la gwasun cigan aga yi tsoci yan tsonbazhi baci Soko nan kiy la aci jina taimakoa yino Ngan a atsozhi u yio be egan wawagi nanazhi atsoe tswa nan
Behold We turned towards thee a company of Jinns quietly listening to the Qur´an when they stood in the presence thereof they said Listen in silence! When the reading was finished they returned to their people to warn them of their sins,Wyo mao pa kami nan yi kan ankali jamaa yan jannu ndocishi zhin eba wyo nan aci fe shi tukpa ya gbigba Alkuranu kami nan atun eba wyo nan aci gan zandondo u sun sun kami nan a sa jin nan aci kezhe daa eba jamaa yanazhi da jina gangba
They said O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses confirming what came before it it guides men to the Truth and to a Straight Path,Aci gan ya ye jamaa yan yizhi akika yi shi yukpa wo litafi ndoci acinu cin be zunma yanMusao u mae gbo egan yan mafarizhi ka wune wu-balo eko gaskiya umae wu ba lo ekpa nan tsoyi gboro nan
O our people hearken to the one who invites you to Allah and believe in him He will forgive you your faults and deliver you from a Penalty Grievous,Yaye jamaa yan yizhi e ye yi yi yan za nae yi zazhi zhin eba Soko na ye mae yau gaskiya wuna fa be ndoci yan zunubi yezhiy uma gae ta tu ke azaba tin tanci lugwa
If any does not hearken to the one who invites us to Allah he cannot frustrate Allah´s Plan on earth and no protectors can he have besides Allah such men wander in manifest error,Soko gwa ta eti kin nan nan boa U ma de ndakata ndoci zunma Soko boa Akika za wuncizhi a fe mini egbin naa tula nao
 See they not that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and never wearied with their creation is able to give life to the dead Yea verily He has power over all things,Kashiy a leye lea ke de Soko nan jin alitta yan sanmazhi to kin nan u wo ebo ndondo eba jin jinaboa yina asa Soko wuncin gboka nan wuna dan eyan tsu tsucizhi rayi wo naa Aa akika Etsu u yio nan gboka dan jin jin yandondo nan
And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire they will be asked Is this not the Truth they will say Yea by our Lord! One will say Then taste ye the Penalty for that ye were wont to deny Truth!,Efo nan a gaa da kafirizhi gwa da kpe enao na acia gana gan asa nan nan ujin gaskiyaa Acia gan gan Acingao eyi zhi kuki be tsoci yi yin gaskiya gauyio U ci gan Efe fin azaba ebo etun kafirinci na ye fe lo na
Therefore patiently persevere as did all messengers of inflexible purpose and be in no haste about the Unbelievers On the Day that they see the Punishment promised them it will be as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day Thine but to proclaim the Message but shall any be destroyed except those who transgress,A ankuri jin kendoe Annabi nanzhiy niyyanazhi gboka nan jin ankuri nan wyo mao ga dinye yaa ma fondondo na aga alkiyamina Sokoe lajina alkawali le ye na atsoa yegan ko afe-dun izhea sai de yan lokaci nini kawanyina Eyan wu tsa yi etun wye yio Amaajin zandondo hallakaa sai de fasikizhi za nanzhie la lefi Soko tula nan
Those who reject Allah and hinder men from the Path of Allah- their deeds will Allah render astray from their mark,Za nanzhi a jin kafirinci nan acie kan zazhi eko Soko yn da nan Etunazhi kpata a nyin ya
But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness and believe in the Revelation sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord- He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition,Za nanzhiy ma a imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi nan a ma imani jin be yan nan acin be ya Annabi muhammadu nan kede u ga yi gaskiya nan fe be dagan nko yan tsocia bo nao na Soko ga etun dede azhi fin ya yaa u ma ga alamariazhi tadzu
But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness and believe in the Revelation sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord- He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition,Za nanzhiy ma a imani jin acie lo tun wangizhi nan a ma imani jin be yan nan acin be ya Annabi muhammadu nan kede u ga yi gaskiya nan fe be dagan nko yan tsocia bo nao na Soko ga etun dede azhi fin ya yaa u ma ga alamariazhi tadzu
 This because those who reject Allah follow vanities while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord Thus does Allah set forth for men their lessons by similitudes,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan kafirizhi a mi-tu eko yan egbin nan muminizhi ma a mi tu gaskiya nan fe be dagan nko yan Tsocia bo nan Acin ga ga Sokoe la misalizhi wu zawangizhio
 Therefore when ye meet the Unbelievers in fight smite at their necks At length when ye have thoroughly subdued them bind a bond firmly on them thereafter is the time for either generosity or ransom Until the war lays down its burdens Thus are ye commanded but if it had been Allah´s Will He could certainly have exacted retribution from them Himself but He lets you fight in order to test you some with others But those who are slain in the Way of Allah- He will never let their deeds be lost,Kamina nan ye ga gun be kafirizhiy ekun dao nan e wua koroo har sai ye gade zankpe ta etia bo yecie laaedan kangi be kagboe Baci acino wuna ba ye yea ya a fea lo koma a tso a la eti tacinaa sa har da lokaci nan nangban yan ekun ga cin-ta nan Acinga gau yio wunaba Soko ba aga zan kafirizhi kpe umaajin be ekun yina Amaa de Soko jinu jin aninga ebo u ma ye yeu cinu le be dozhi Akika za nanzhi a gaawu fi eko Soko nan etunazhi a ta yakpea
Soon will He guide them and improve their condition,Bele yin Soko gaajin shiri u ma ga alamariazhi tadzu
 And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them,Uma gaa laa gandan Aljannanao nan ufe yaa labari u nan
O ye who believe! If ye will aid the cause of Allah He will aid you and plant your feet firmly,Ya ye nazhia imani jin nan ye ga jin Soko taimako wuntsoa jine taimako ga uma ga kinigi yezhigboka
But those who reject Allah- for them is destruction and Allah will render their deeds astray from their mark,Zanazhiy maajin kafirinci nan hallaka gaajin tabbata yaa etunazhi ma ga nyin ya
 That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah so He has made their deeds fruitless,Wunci ma yi ebo na a navo nan a lami tu na Soko cinbe yn nan Soko cia etunazhi nyin ya
Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them who did evil Allah brought utter destruction on them and similar fates await those who reject Allah,Kashiy a za az kpe eti kinboa acia le kendoe zoba yan za nazhiy shiadzo na yi yi naa Ngan Soko ajin hallaka to iri wuncin ma gaajin tabbata ya kafirizhi
 That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe but those who reject Allah have no protector,Wuncin ma yiebo nan Soko ga yi Ndakata yan minizhio nao akika ma kafirizhi de ndakataa
Verily Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to Gardens beneath which rivers flow while those who reject Allah will enjoy this world and eat as cattle eat and the Fire will be their abode,Akika Soko ga za nanzhiy ga jin imani a cie lo tun wngi zhi nan la gan dan Aljannao nan nuwan zhie je fi tako shinu zhio nan Kafirizhi ma e wo ma izhe za amae gi yanza kendoe dabbazhie gi yanzhi za na akika enan ga yi ezhe kebao
 And how many cities with more power than thy city which has driven thee out have We destroyed for their sins and there was none to aid them,Alkaryazhi danbo dokun nanzhiy gboka gan za alkarya wyozhi nan zhiy nyanwyo tin ya nan kpata yi ajin hallaka a made zandondo jina taimakoa
 Is then one who is on a clear Path from his Lord no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing and such as follow their own lustsNgba za nae le izhe eti hujja nan fe be nko yan tsoci ubo nan gazhe yeni beza nan etun dedeuzhi a sa fiu acie le izhe eti etun yangbano nan,
Here is a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised in it are rivers of water incorruptible rivers of milk of which the taste never changes rivers of wine a joy to those who drink and rivers of honey pure and clear In it there are for them all kinds of fruits and Grace from their Lord Can those in such Bliss be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels to pieces,Kwatankoci yan kendoe Aljanna nan Soko ajin muminizhi alkawali na uyi nan minin bo eduzhi danbo yan nuwan nan jin vunvucia nan To eduzhi danbo yan nuwan nono nan emanu wune zhegbaa nan to eduzhidanbo yan efu nan yi lilici nan ama ke yibe yangici sun sun iri ndondoe fi bo ganni be gaafarae dagan eba tsociabo Ngba aga za na zhi fi mini nima nanao tutun na laasan tatu be za nan gun mini enao tutun yin nan Ganci acie ya nuwan yipa fin nae dza edinazhi ya nan
 And among them are men who listen to thee but in the end when they go out from thee they say to those who have received Knowledge What is it he said just then Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed and who follow their own lusts,Ama de dan miniabo nanzhiy ajin ashi tukpa ya wy nan kami nan a ga tin ya dagan eba wyo bo nan a fe gan be gan be za nan zhiy yi be ilimiy nan gan Ngba kiufe gan mangio Za wuncinzhi ga Soko te yangbanao acia-mitu etun yangbanazhi
But to those who receive Guidance He increases the light of Guidance and bestows on them their Piety and Restraint from evil,Za nazhiy ma gaajin shiri nan Soko  abea shiri U maa Twarya be dansun uyio dan yang Banabo
Do they then only wait for the Hour- that it should come on them of a sudden But already have come some tokens thereof and when it actually is on them how can they benefit then by their admonition,Kashiy e tu yetu gan alkiyami ubeu dzun u fia Akika alamauzhi da bea ni Ke a be jin jin nao kami nan Yan nae la jin gangbanan ga bea tula yaa nao
Know therefore that there is no god but Allah and ask forgiveness for thy fault and for the men and women who believe for Allah knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes,wyo yo kpeo wo ke de akika adeyandondo nan gwo yin a jin bauta ya naa sai de Soko na wyo mao wa gafarao ya zunubi wyizhi to Mumini ba Gizhi to mumini ynzagizhi akika Soko de kpikpi yan ba nan zhi ye iwo nan U ma de kpikpi yan ezhe kebaezhi
 Those who believe say Why is not a sura sent down for us But when a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with a look of one in swoon at the approach of death But more fitting for them-,Za nanzhia imani jin nan e gan gan kiY la aci cin sura Woro bea yino Kami nan a ga be cin Sura yan hukunci ndoci be yaa aci tun ekun ye danminiiubo nan Wyoa le Munafikizhi ye a fe cin wyo le ke za nan nangban yan ajali a rukpeu nan robonkpe wunajin tabbata yaa
 Were it to obey and say what is just and when a matter is resolved on it were best for them if they were true to Allah,Emi latu foro be egan wangi gane u ga gye gano Kaminan alamari gaa gbo ucia tula Ke ekun gun ga gano nan a ga Soko ya gaskiya ya a cia tin ya da wuncinade alheri yagan
 Then is it to be expected of you if ye were put in authority that ye will do mischief in the land and break your ties of kith and kin,Akika kyengi u yio yega bea zunma zheta yeci da gun kuna yea bea fe za nanzhie nyin yan kpe eti kinbo nan ye ci gaafe za nan zhie sa dangi bo ya na
Such are the men whom Allah has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight,Za wuncinzhi ga Soko bu kuti kpeo u cia te tukpa Ucia eyeazhi nan e le gaskiya ye bea sai ganmanan
Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur´an or are their hearts locked up by them,Kashiy e kpa ye kpa nan shidunan eti Alkuranu boa Kashiy a giyekozhi laatsua yangbanzhi tsu
Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes,Akika za nazhi a zunma laa ya a adini nanacia jin ridda baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula yaani nan akika Sheitan ga pa kafirinci nin fi ao wunga ma gan gan fia eti bo

 This because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed We will obey you in part of this matter but Allah knows their inner secrets,Wuncin mayi ebo nan a gan be za nazhie na hukunci nan Soko cinzhiyn vo nan gan Yi ga mi tu ye dan mini alamari ndocizhio Akika Soko de kpikpe yannazhiy e swo nan

But how will it be when the angels take their souls at death and smite their faces and their backs,Gancin Kea da da nao kami nan Malaikazhi gae gwo rayi bea yin acie wua fuskazhio to zunmazhio nao
 This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of Allah and they hated Allah´s good pleasure so He made their deeds of no effect,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan a emi laatu yan nan Soko waa nan acia nanvo laa dan yedajinu bo nan U cia etunzhi gbin ya
 Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not bring to light all their rancour,Kashiy za nan zhiy yi be batan yan yangbanenae kpa ye kpa gan eyan dede nazhiy a swo fi yangbano nan Soko a kua tin ya woa
 Had We so wiled We could have shown them up to thee and thou shouldst have known them by their marks but surely thou wilt know them by the tone of their speech! And Allah knows all that ye doU ga ba Yi ba da yi ga la wu wye akika ma wyo gaa kpeye be alamaazhiy wyo maa kezhe kpea ye eba egan kogiazhio Akika Soko de kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye lo nan,

Those who reject Allah hinder men from the Path of Allah and resist the Messenger after Guidance has been clearly shown to them will not injure Allah in the least but He will make their deeds of no effect,Akika za nazhie jin kafirci acie kan zawangizhi eko Soko yn da nan ama kezhea le tuci ba baci nan bayani yan bawu a tula ya aa ni na a la egun ndondotso Soko woa Soko ma gaa etunzhi nyi ya
 O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger and make not vain your deeds!,Ya ye nazhia imani jin nan! Yea mi tu Soko ye mae la mie tu tuci ye mae ga nyin etunezhi ya ma
 Those who reject Allah and hinder men from the Path of Allah then die rejecting Allah- Allah will not forgive them,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci acie kan zawangizhi eko yan Soko yn da nan gancin acia tsu eti kafirincio nan Soko fa bea yina
 Be not weary and faint-hearted crying for peace when ye should be uppermost for Allah is with you and will never put you in loss for your good deeds,Ega to gbogun ma Ye mae ga tana gwa fe wa gyra bea yin ma Akika yega ta eti abo Soko ma dan be ye yin U maa ta etun yezhi ya kpea
The life of this world is but play and amusement and if ye believe and guard against Evil He will grant you your recompense and will not ask you to give up your possessions,Akika rayuwa izhe edzo u yio be Shagalae Ye ma ga imani jin ye cie sundan Soko U maa gbin yegan yan dukiya yezhia
If He were to ask you for all of them and press you ye would covetously withhold and He would bring out all your ill-feeling,Uga gbin ye gan yan dukiya yezhi ye gau le ye eba yiba nan yemaafe tan yanbo U ma ga eyan dede nazhiy ye pa fi yangbano nan ku ke fi-li
 Behold ye are those invited to spend of your substance in the Way of Allah But among you are some that are niggardly But any who are niggardly are so at the expense of their own souls But Allah is free of all wants and it is ye that are needy If ye turn back from the Path He will substitute in your stead another people then they would not be like you!,Ye dan nan ye ga e yi gan ye be wu dukiyayezhie fi eko Soko bo mini ebo ade nazhie tanyanbo na akika zaeni ndondo na ga tan yanbo nan eti tacinu gau tan be yino Soko Etsu kunkunke u yio yetso tsa yi talakazhio Ye ma ga zunma zheta U gae sangwa be zandocizhiy amaafe yanbotanci dozhine zhia

 And that Allah may help thee with powerful help,Soko ma ajino taimako taimako nantsoa zankpe nan
It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Believers that they may add faith to their faith- for to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth and Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom-,Wun ga yi Etsu nan cin yangban tacin be dan yangban Muminizhi bo nan ebo a de baabe imania be imania kagbocizhi kpata yan sanmazhi to yan kin Soko wuna o akika Soko maafe Etsu nan yibe kpikpe yandondoe nan Etsu hikima
That He may admit the men and women who believe to Gardens beneath which rivers flow to dwell therein for aye and remove their ills from them- and that is in the sight of Allah the highest achievement for man-,Ebou la mumini bagizhi to mumini ynzagizhi u ganu dan aljannazhio nanzhiy nuwanzhie je fi taakoabo na amaa fibo fi tutun yin u ma ga etun dedeazhi kpata finya wuncin maafe rabo nan wancin ana
 And that He may punish the Hypocrites men and women and the Polytheists men and women who imagine an evil opinion of Allah On them is a round of Evil the Wrath of Allah is on them He has cursed them and got Hell ready for them and evil is it for a destination,Umau la munafiki bagizhi to munafikiynzagizhi to bagi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci nan to yinzagi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na u jin azaba za nazhie kpa-ye dede be Sokoe nan hallaka gaajin tabbata ta etia bo Soko maa zhe-wunbeayin uma kuti bu kpea u maenan yan jahannama jin shiri yaa akika zobaazhi maa biye
For to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth and Allah is Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom,Kagbocizhi kpata yan samazhi to kin Soko wuno akika Soko maafe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima
We have truly sent thee as a witness as a bringer of Glad Tidings and as a Warner,Akika yi ya wyo tun tun wyo lao fe za naajin ri nan to za nae ya labari yangban fa nan to za nae jin gangba nan
 In order that ye O men may believe in Allah and His Messenger that ye may assist and honour Him and celebrate His praise morning and evening,Ebo acino yea imani jin be Sokoe to be tuciu yin ye mae jinu taimako ye mae fe liu tsa tsa yin to lazhin to lozun
Verily those who plight their fealty to thee do no less than plight their fealty to Allah the Hand of Allah is over their hands then any one who violates his oath does so to the harm of his own soul and any one who fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah- Allah will soon grant him a great Reward,Akika za nazhie jin mubayaa zunmatu yan baeni be wyo yin nan akika Soko tsa ajin mubayaa beyino yin nan akika Soko ta eti egwaazhio gancin za nan ga alkawaliu loya nan eti taciu tsau jin guno zaeni ndondo na ma ga yan nan wunajin Soko alkawali nan she nan Soko ayau lada nan wancin nan
The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to thee We were engaged in looking after our flocks and herds and our families do thou then ask forgiveness for us They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts Say Who then has any power at all to intervene on your behalf with Allah if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit But Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do,Beleyin za nazhiy yi za zunmazhi na nanzhi dzunda gunkunana mini larubawa laticizhio na a gan gan dukiya yizhi to iyali yizhi a yi jin shagala wyo ga jinoba gafara ya yi Acie gan gan be gintaraazhiy na ma ujin acin uyi dan yangbanazhi boa nan Gan gan ziy kangwa yandoci ya ye woo Uga kpa ye be mimacinle ndoci ko ma be eyan anfani ndociy nao Aa akika Soko Etsu u yio nan yi be labari etun nazhiy ye lonae

And if any believe not in Allah and His Messenger We have prepared for those who reject Allah a Blazing Fire!,Zaeni ndondo na ma ya Soko be tuciu yin gaskiyaa nan da akika yi jin shiri yan azaba ena sairu ya kafirizhi
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills but Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Soko ga wun mulki yan sanmazhi to kin yino fe be za nan ga bau nan Umae jin za na bau na azaba Akika Soko a fe Etsu gafara Etsu yegun
 Those who lagged behind will say when ye are free to march and take booty in war Permit us to follow you They wish to change Allah´s decree Say Not thus will ye follow us Allah has already declared this beforehand then they will say But ye are jealous of us Nay but little do they understand such things,Beleyin eza zunma wuncinzhi a gan gan kamina nan ye gae lo gani ma arziki yan ekun zhiyn kuzhi nan e lugwa yi la mitu ye yiy e wa gana la egan Soko a zhe gba Gangan yeala mi tu yi yia a cinga ga Soko gan shidzo Gannci a gan gan u jin acina ye de jin yi hasada jin kawanyin Uma yi acina ammade a deafe za nanzhiy egane yea nan sai de za degi miniabo
Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind Ye shall be summoned to fight against a people given to vehement war then shall ye fight or they shall submit Then if ye show obedience Allah will grant you a goodly reward but if ye turn back as ye did before He will punish you with a grievous Penalty,Gan ya za nazhi yi za zunmazhi mini larubawa laticizhio nan Bele yin a be yi ye lo eba jamaa ndocizhinanzhiy gboka sarawyin nan ebo ye dae guna kun ko ma a la lo musulunci ye ga mitu foro nan nan Sokoa yae laa da nayi wangi naye ma ga zunma zheta kendoe ye kayn jin shidzo batsozhi na Wuna jine azaba nan tan sarauyin anan
No blame is there on the blind nor is there blame on the lame nor on one ill if he joins not the war But he that obeys Allah and his Messenger- Allah will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow and he who turns back Allah will punish him with a grievous Penalty,Leifi ta eti yebonci boa kagan ulo ekun daa naa to za nan de bicia nan boa Zaeni ndondo nan ga mitu Soko to Tuciu nan u gau laagandan aljannazhio nan nuwanzie je fi takoshinu bo nan za ndondo na ma ga zunma zheta nan Wuna jinu azaba nan tan sarayin nan
Allah´s Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down Tranquillity to them and He rewarded them with a speedy VictoryAkika Sokoa yeda jin be Muminizhiy kami nan afe jin mubayaa be wyo yin eshin yan cigbano nan Soko ma kpe yannanzhiy fi yangbana bo nan Uci ci yangban tacin be yaa Ucin kezhe yaa nasara nan tsoba nan,
And many gains will they acquire besides and Allah is Exalted in Power Full of Wisdom,Ganni be ganimazhiy nan dokun nan naade nan Soko maafe Etsu zankpe Etsu hikima
 Allah has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire and He has given you these beforehand and He has restrained the hands of men from you that it may be a Sign for the Believers and that He may guide you to a Straight Path,Soko ma kezhe jin ye alkawali ndoci yan ganima nan yea de nan u cia nan nan fan fi ye U maa kun ke ya ye be ekun zawangizhiy ebo ulaufe a ya  u ya Muminizhi U mau wu ye bau lo eko nantso yi gborona
 And other gains there are which are not within your power but which Allah has compassed and Allah has power over all things,To ndoci nan ye kunke wo ta etiaboa Nan akika Soko ama kezhe Akika Soko ma de kagbo taeti yandon
 If the Unbelievers should fight you they would certainly turn their backs then would they find neither protector nor helper,Da aci gan kafirizhi ga gun ye kun gun daa bici gancin ma aade Ndakataa amaa de taimako jincia
Such has been the practice approved of Allah already in the past no change wilt thou find in the practice approved of Allah,Nan nan ma ekpa yan Soko u yio nan -- gan ta eti zananzhiy shidzo nao Wyo maa de egbazhe ndondo dan ekpa Soko boa
 And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka after that He gave you the victory over them And Allah sees well all that ye do,Wun ga yi za nan kangwa ekun azhi ya ye yeo nan U ci kangwa ekun ye ya atsoo zhinin yan Makabo baci nan wuna ye laa ta eti boani nao Akika Soko a fe Etsu nae cinye le dan etun ndondo na ye gae lo nao
 They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals detained from reaching their place of sacrifice Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without your knowledge Allah would have allowed you to force your way but He held back your hands that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will If they had been apart We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment,A ga yi za nanzhi ajin kafirinci nao acia ye kan gingandan yan Masallaci Harami nan to Hadayaotso aci u kanta a lugwa utun dannan wuna Kagan ujin ebo bagi Mumini ndocizhi to ynzagi Mumina ndocizhi boa nanzhiy-ma ye kpeayea naa yina ebo ye bea wu mimacinle ndoci be tswan ye eboabo ye ma kpea ma Soko ma jinacin jin ebo u la za nan ga bau nanU ganu dan mini yegunu bo Da aci gan zawuncizhi akpe kayin kpe da Yiga kafirizhi mini-abo jin azaba nan tan sarauyin nan
 While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance- Allah sent down His Tranquillity to his Messenger and to the Believers and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it And Allah has full knowledge of all things,Kami nan kafirizhia egya yan nanvo laafi yangbana zhio nan egya yan nanvo na ma yi yan jahiliyyah nan ezati zhkozhi Soko cia yangbanshiu cin be ya Tuciu to Muminizhi Ucia egan yan dansun Soko laa gboka yaa Amaafe shiubo a ga gwouyino aga mayi zaba wuno Akika Soko yi be kpikpe yandondoe

The selfish soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother he murdered him and became himself one of the lost onesUcia sa fiu yan gbano na uga yegiuwu na uma ciuwu ga gan cin ucia tinba wyunafe dan mini eza hasarazhio,

 On that account We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people and if any one saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs yet even after that many of them continued to commit excesses in the land,Ebo dalili wuncino Yiciu la jin wajibi ta eti Bani Israilazhio kede akika zandondo na ga rayi wu na Uma yi be hakki yan rayi ndocia na koma eyan nyin kpe eti kinboa na to le fi za wuncin uyi ke yan za naa zawangizhi kpata ku wu na za na maga rayi nini dan rayi na laadau yi ke za naa zawangizhi kpata dan rayi na Akika ma Tuci Yizhi be yaa be bayanizhi gancin akika kundondo miniabo baci wuncino afe za nazhi nyin yan kpe eti kinbo na
 The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution or crucifixion or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land that is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter,Akika egagba yan za nazhie gun kun be Sokoe to be Tunci Uyin na acie lotun fikinbo eti eyan nyino na gara da uga yi alaa wu ko ma alaafosa koma ala egwazhi to biciazhia koaya eti cice leba dozhio koma alaa nyan dagan kinboWuncin zun yesun uyi yaao dan mini izheo azaba na ma wancin na gaajin tabbata yaa dan emi zobao

As to those who reject Faith- if they had everything on earth and twice repeated to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment it would never be accepted of them theirs would be a grievous penalty,Akika za nazhia jin kafirinci na daaci gan yannazhi fi kinbo kpata na aga wuno to ndoci dozhinube ebo alaasa etia dagan azaba Efo Alkiyamiy a gwo egwaaboa azaba nama tan saranyinna gajin tabbata yaa
Their wish will be to get out of the Fire but never will they get out therefrom their penalty will be one that endures,Ewa gan alaadzuna tinaya dagan mini enao ama jin za nazhia dzun tinya bo naa azaba na tsoa fedun na wuna jin tabbata yaa
As to the thief Male or female cut off his or her hands a punishment by way of example from Allah for their crime and Allah is Exalted in power,To igbeci bagi to igbeci yinzagi yea egwaazhi gubaba ko ya egagba uyio yan woce na ace nao azaba yan ewunna uyio dagan eba Soko Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
But if the thief repents after his crime and amends his conduct Allah turneth to him in forgiveness for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Zandondo na ga tuba jin na baci yan zwalunci na ujin na uci kezhea haliu tadzu na akika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
Knowest thou not that to Allah alone belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth He punisheth whom He pleaseth and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and Allah hath power over all things,Kashi wyo kpe kpe gan akika Soko ga wun mulki samazhi to kin yino wyunejin za na ga ba una azaba Soko ma de kagbo ta eti yandondo
O Messenger! let not those grieve thee who race each other into unbelief whether it be among those who say We believe with their lips but whose hearts have no faith or it be among the Jews- men who will listen to any lie- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee They change the words from their right times and places they say If ye are given this take it but if not beware! If any one´s trial is intended by Allah thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah For such - it is not Allah´s will to purify their hearts For them there is disgrace in this world and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment,Ya wyoe Tuci!

 They are fond of listening to falsehood of devouring anything forbidden If they do come to thee either judge between them or decline to interfere If thou decline they cannot hurt thee in the least If thou judge judge in equity between them For Allah loveth those who judge in equity,Ezazhi ayio nazhie dokun be tukpshiy ya ganmana na amae dokun be gi gi haramuy ebo acino aga be eba wyoe jin hukunci tsakaniabo ko ma wyo dzun ganabo Wyo ma gaa dzun ganabo ala egun ndondo tso wyoe woa wyo ma gaajin hukunci to jin hukunci tsakaniabo be adalinciy Akika Soko wyune wa za nazhi gae jin adalinci na
But why do they come to thee for decision when they have their own law before them- therein is the plain command of Allah yet even after that they would turn away For they are not really People of Faith,Ki ma la acie be ba wyoe eti hukunci bo alali ma litafi Attaura danbeayin miniubo ma hukunci Soko danbo ganci acie la zunma zheta baaci yan bayani wuncin bo Za wuncinzhi nazhie jin aninga na ajin muminizhia
It was We who revealed the law to Moses therein was guidance and light By its standard have been judged the Jews by the prophets who bowed as in Islam to Allah´s will by the rabbis and the doctors of law for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah´s book and they were witnesses thereto therefore fear not men but fear me and sell not my signs for a miserable price If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed they are no better than Unbelievers,Akika yicin litafi Attaura miniubo mabawu danbo to haske Annabizhi nazhia kpatsun ta ya foro Soko baenio na e laujinhukunci ya yahuduzhi to man nazhie wuzazhi ba lo eba Soko na to man kpikpezhi be iri yanna awa bea yin yan tswitswa litafi Soko na atsomaafe eri yacizhi eti wuncino Ebo acino ega sundan zawangizhi ma e sundan Mi ye maega la aya mi dashi eyan tetengi izhe ma Zandondo na mae jin hukunci be yanna Soko cinzhin yinana to zawuncinzhi ga yi kafiri zhio
We ordained therein for them Life for life eye for eye nose or nose ear for ear tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity it is an act of atonement for himself And if any fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed they are No better than wrong-doers,Yi ma hukunci jin tiile ta eti abo dan miniubo kede ala rayia wu na wyuntso ga rayi wuna ala eya zaawa wyuntso ga wa za eye na to eye be eye to tukpa be tukpae to yikan be yikane to eba eba yinzhio egagba yan jinjinga ga wunayio Gancin za na ga be fa ucia yan wyin jin sadaka na to wuncin gaafe kafara yau Zandondona mae jin hukunci be yan na Soko cin be yina na to za wuncinzhi ga yi azwalumizhio
And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary confirming the Law that had come before him We sent him the Gospel therein was guidance and light and confirmation of the Law that had come before him a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah,Yicia dida laadan eti etaazhio be Isah egi Maryamuy wyune ya gaskiya be yanna be shiudzo dagan mini Attaurao na yi ma litafi Injeela laa yau miniubo bawu danbo to haske wyuntso mae ya gaskiya be yan na beshidzo dagan mini Attaurao na Uma yi bawu be waaziy ya za nazhi gae sundan Soko na
 Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed they are no better than those who rebel,To jamaa yan litafi Injeeluzhi ajin hukunci be yanna Soko cin be fi bo na Zandondo na maejin hukunci be yanna Soko cin be yina na to za wuncinzhi agayi fasikizhio
To thee We sent the Scripture in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and guarding it in safety so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed and follow not their vain desires diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way If Allah had so willed He would have made you a single people but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you so strive as in a race in all virtues The goal of you all is to Allah it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute,Yi ma litafi cin bea ya wyoe be gaskiyae na mae ya gaskiya be yanna zhi be shiudzo dagan mini litafio na na ma kezhe afe etswa ta eti abo na Ebo acino jin hukunci tsakaniabo be yanna Soko cin beyn na wyo mao ga la mi tu etun yangbanazhi ke yanna be ya wyoe dagan mini gaskiyao na lugwa ma Zandondo mini ebo yi yia sharia laa yau be kendoe uga dada cia emi tuu na Be ma wuna ba Soko ba da uga ye laafe alumma nini kete ammaade ebo u ma ye yeu cinu le dan mini erytwa nazhi ula ya ye nao Ebo acino efe sanganna dan jin jin alheri zhio Baenio eba Soko bo ezhekebae dano gancin Ucia ya ye labari be yannazhi ye fe ce dozhi leba fi miniabo na 
Do they then seek after a judgment of the days of ignorance But who for a people whose faith is assured can give better judgment than Allah,Kashi hukunci yan jahilizhi nazhi kpe Soko yea na wyun ga ewa zao ZiI ma danbo naajin bolo gan eba hukunci jino naagan Soko nao ya za nazhi imaniazhi agboka nao
O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors They are but friends and protectors to each other And he amongst you that turns to them for friendship is of them Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la yahuduzhi to Nasarazhi eya mancizhi ma Sashiazhi eya mancizhi ayio ya sashio Zandondo na magae laa eyamanci mini ebo na to akika wyun tso afe dan mini abo Aakika Sokoe la-jamaa yan azwalumizhi ke eko wangia
Those in whose hearts is a disease - thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them saying We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster Ah! perhaps Allah will give thee victory or a decision according to His will Then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harboured in their hearts,Wyo a le za nazhi batan fi yangbanazhio na ye edinye da lo dan miniabo acie gan gan Yi esundan ebo masiba ndoci be tswan yi ma To kengi uyio na Sokoa la eko kpe ndoci beyn koma foro ndoci dagan nko Ubo gancin acia bea fe za nazhi eti ro-- nkpe na eti eyan dede nazhi afe swofi yangbanazhio na
And those who believe will say Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by Allah that they were with you All that they do will be in vain and they will fall into nothing but ruin,Za nazhi maaimani jin na cie gan gan Ngba zanazhi ga zhikuti be Sokoe har da iyaka kutizhiazhi kede akika be ye yin adano nao Etunazhi a gbin ya acia fe eza hasarazhi
O ye who believe! if any from among you turn back from his Faith soon will Allah produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him- lowly with the believers mighty against the rejecters fighting in the way of Allah and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault That is the grace of Allah which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth And Allah encompasseth all and He knoweth all things,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Your real friends are no less than Allah His Messenger and the fellowship of believers- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity and they bow down humbly in worship,Akika Ndakatako ye nayi eyamanciko ye na Ugayi Soko to Tuciu to zanazhia imani jin nao za nazhie ku swallah gikini na amae wa zakka na amae dokun be lulo yan ruku-na
As to those who turn for friendship to Allah His Messenger and the fellowship of believers- it is the fellowship of Allah that must certainly triumph,Zandondo na ga Soko la Ndakatako nayi eyamanciko na to Tuciu to zanazhia imani jin na to akika jamaa yan Soko zhi aga wun zankpeo
O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport- whether among those who received the Scripture before you or among those who reject Faith but fear ye Allah if ye have faith indeed,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la za nazhie la adini yemi acie lau dzodzo dagan mini zaba litafizhi nazhi shiye dzo na to kafirizhi masoyizhi ma Ye mae sundan Soko wunayi muminizhi ga ye yio na
 When ye proclaim your call to prayer they take it but as mockery and sport that is because they are a people without understanding,Kamina Ye gae yi zazhi lo jin jin swalla na u la eyan emila be edzoe Wuncin ma yi ebo na afe zanazhi de ankalia na
Say O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before us and perhaps that most of you are rebellious and disobedient,Gan gan ya ye za ba litafizhi! Kashi ye le lefi yi le ye Wuncin dea yi ebo gaskita na yi ya be Sokoe na to yanna acin be zhiudzo na uma yi ebo na ekun dondo yezhi fasikizhi ye yio na
Say Shall I point out to you something much worse than this as judged by the treatment it received from Allah those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine those who worshipped evil- these are many times worse in rank and far more astray from the even path!,Gan gan Ngba min ya ye labari yan yandoci na tso biye gan wuncin ega gbao eba Soko na Uga yi za na Soko u bomi ucia zhe wun beu yin nao ucia ndocizhi miniabo laazhe ebegizhi tokpuutsun zhi to nazhi wun tagutu eyandedezhi na Zawunci zhi ga yi eza kinigi ba bi bi cizhio aga ma fu ya gano ke eko wangi lugwao
When they come to thee they say We believe but in fact they enter with a mind against Faith and they go out with the same but Allah knoweth fully all that they hide,Agan-gan-dan be kafirinciy atso ma de kpi kpi gan eti yan nazhi afe-swo na
Many of them dost thou see racing each other in sin and rancour and their eating of things forbidden Evil indeed are the things that they do,Wyo maale kun-dondo miniabo ye afe san nin dan mini etun lefio be gbin gbintu iyaka Sokoe to gigi azhi yan yangici haramuzhio Akika bibi be gwosuny ajin tabbata ya etun nazhie lo na
Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of Law forbid them from their habit of uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden Evil indeed are their works,Kil la man yan Soko ye kpezhi to man wancikozhi ci kana egan le fizhi to gi gi yan haramua yino Akika bibi be gwosuny wuna jin tabbata ya etun nazhi a fe lo na
 The Jews say Allah´s hand is tied up Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the blasphemy they utter Nay both His hands are widely outstretched He giveth and spendeth of His bounty as He pleaseth But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment Every time they kindle the fire of war Allah doth extinguish it but they ever strive to do mischief on earth And Allah loveth not those who do mischief,Yahuduzhi ma gan Egwa Soko a wan gwo u twarya wo bea  A egwaatso wanpa gwo kuruo amaa bomi ebo egan dede na agan na Aa ujin acina egau guba ba kpikpeci ayio titacimaayio gubaba wyune laaaya alittazhi kendoe ga bau na Akika ma yan na acin be ya wyoe dagan eba Tsoci wyobo na wuna be ekun dondo miniabo eti kagbo be kafirinciy-be Yi ma ewun sun be nanvoe laace dan tsakaniabo har da Efo Alkiyami Kandondo na aga ena dan yan ekun gun Sokoe lau nu Acie jin dalo dazhin fi kinbo eti eyan nyino alali ma Sokoe wa za za nazhie nyin yan naa
 If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous We should indeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to gardens of bliss,Da aci gan akika zaba litafizhi a imani jinjin aci sundan Soko da yi ga etun dedeazhi pa ya ya da yi ma gaa lagandan Aljannazhio nazhi yi emi ni ima na
If only they had stood fast by the Law the Gospel and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord they would have enjoyed happiness from every side There is from among them a party on the right course but many of them follow a course that is evil,Da aci gan a litafi Attaura to Injeela ku ku gikini to litafi ndoci naacin be yaa dagan eba Tsoci abo na daa Soko maa fe yaa yangici dagan fititiabo to dagan tako bicitaabo Miniabo jamaazhi danbo nazhi yi za tatacin na ekun dondo miniabo ma etun nazhie lo na wuna biye
O Messenger! proclaim the message which hath been sent to thee from thy Lord If thou didst not thou wouldst not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission And Allah will defend thee from men who mean mischief For Allah guideth not those who reject Faith,Ya wyoe Tuci! A wyan wu yan yanna acin be ya wyoe dagan eba Tsoci wyo bo na kagan wyo ma jin acina to wyo wuyan etun naatun wyo naa dano na Akika Sokoe la jamaa yan kafirizhi ke eko gunua
Say O People of the Book! ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law the Gospel and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord that increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy But sorrow thou not over these people without Faith,Gan gan Ya ye zaba litafizhi!

 Those who believe in the Qur´an those who follow the Jewish scriptures and the Sabians and the Christians- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day and work righteousness- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Akika za nazhi imani jin nato za nazhi ga tuba jin mini yahuduzhio na to swabiuzhiza nazhia pan ke eko lugwa na to Nasarazhi ndondo na ga imani jin be Sokoe na to be Efo Alkiyami na uci kezhe lo tun wangi na to dansun danbo yaa to yangban yin ndondo ma danbo yaa
We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers every time there came to them a messenger with what they themselves desired not - some of these they called impostors and some they go so far as to slay,Akika yi la alkawali br Bani Israilazhiyi ma tun Tucizhi fia kandondo na Tuci ga be yaa be yan nazhi ba yangbanazhia na sashizhi u yi ganmana sashi ndoci ma a fe wu Tucizhi
They thought there would be no trial or punishment so they became blind and deaf yet Allah in mercy turned to them yet again many of them became blind and deaf But Allah sees well all that they do,Aci fe kpaye gan fitina ndondoa naa gancin acia na ye a maa te tukpa gancin Soko ci fa bea yin gancin ekundondoazhi ci kezhea na ye acia te tukpa Soko mae cina le be iri etu nazhi elo na
 They do blaspheme who say Allah is Christ the son of Mary But said Christ O Children of Israel! worship Allah my Lord and your Lord Whoever joins other gods with Allah- Allah will forbid him the garden and the Fire will be his abode There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help,Akika za nazhiga gan gan Akika Masihu egi Maryama gayi Soko na a jin kafirinci Masihu ma gan Ya ye Bani Israilazhie jin bauta ya Soko na yi Tsoci mi to Tsoci ye na Akika zandondo nagae la yan pa Soko baci na akika Sokoa Aljanna laazhe haramu yau ecin bauma yi ena azwalumizhi maade zanazhia jina taimako naa

They do blaspheme who say Allah is one of three in a Trinity for there is no god except One Allah If they desist not from their word of blasphemy verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them,Akika za nazhi gan gan Akika Soko za taci yan guta u yio na a jin kafirinci ama de Tsoci ndocia sai de Tsoci nini ketekagan ma akegan be yannaegan na yana akika azaba na tan na gaa two za nazhia jin kafirinci miniabo

Why turn they not to Allah and seek His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most MercifulKashi a ga tuba jin lo eba Sokoa amaa ba gafara be U yina alali ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uma yio,
 Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger many were the messengers that passed away before him His mother was a woman of truth They had both to eat their daily food See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth!,Masihu egi Maryama ufea sai de Tuci kawanyi Akika Tucizhima a be shiu dzoani nnau ma eza gaskiya uyio Amaa fe za nazhie gi yan gici naNgba cinle kendoe yie jin bayani ayazhi yaa na gancin wyo mao cino le kendoe ekua ke eko gaskiya lugwa na
Say Will ye worship besides Allah something which hath no power either to harm or benefit you But Allah- He it is that heareth and knoweth all things,Gan gan Kashi ye ajin bauta yandoci yan Soko na de mulki ndoci ta eti eyan guno ko eyan anfani yaye yea na Soko ma Uga yi Etsu nae wo yandondo nao Etsu na yi be kpikpe yandondoe nao
 Say O people of the Book! exceed not in your religion the bounds of what is proper trespassing beyond the truth nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by- who misled many and strayed themselves from the even way,Gan gan Ya ye zaba litafizhi! Ega gwo iyaka gan dan adiniebo eti yan na jin gaskiyaa na ma ye mae ga lami tu etun yangbanzhi yan za nazhia gbin zhidzoani a ma ekun dondo zazhi gbin na ma Atso maa gbin ke eko gborolugwa
Curses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected Faith by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses,A emibo kpe za nazhia jin kafirinci mini bani Israilazhio na be gintara Dawuda to Isa egi Maryamae Wuncin ma ma yi ebo lefia boamaafe za na zhie gbin iyaka tu na
Nor did they usually forbid one another the iniquities which they committed evil indeed were the deeds which they did,Afe e kan etun dede nazhie lo naa Akika etun nazhi afe lo na wuna bi ye
 Nor did they usually forbid one another the iniquities which they committed evil indeed were the deeds which they did,Afe e kan etun dede nazhie lo naa Akika etun nazhi afe lo na wuna bi ye
Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers Evil indeed are the works which their souls have sent forward before them with the result that Allah´s wrath is on them and in torment will they abide,Wyoa le ekundondo miniabo ye akafirizhi la masoyizhi Akika yanna ala shidzo ya eti tacina na wuna bi ye ebo na Sokoa zhe wun bea yin amaafi mini azabao tutun yin
 If only they had believed in Allah in the Prophet and in what hath been revealed to him never would they have taken them for friends and protectors but most of them are rebellious wrong-doers,Da aci gan afe za nazhia imani jin be Sokoe to be Annabiy to yan na acin be yau na da ala kafirizhi masoyizhia Ammaade ekundondo miniabo fasikizhi ayio
Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say We are Christians because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world and they are not arrogant,Akika wyoa tsun za nazhi gboka gan eba nanvo yaza nazhia imani jin na a ga yi Yahuduzhio to za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na Wyo maatsun nazhi tso baa gan eba cincino ya za nazhia imani jin na aga yi za nazhi gan gan Akika yi Nasarazhi yi yio nao Wuncin ma yi ebo na ade Manzhi dan miniabo nazhia cin-dan kpikpe wao na to Man nazhi acin dan ibadao na hakikama ajin zanazhie lati dan fino naa
And when they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger thou wilt see their eyes overflowing with tears for they recognise the truth they pray Our Lord! we believe write us down among the witnesses,Kamina aga wo yannaacin be ya Tuci na wyo a le eyeazhi ye wune je egiye ebo kpikpe nazhi ade yan gaskiya na acie gan gan Tuci yi! yi yia gaskiya ya ebo acino a yi kadan mini eri jincizhio
 What cause can we have not to believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous,Kima dan be yi yino har na yi yia jin imani be Soko yina na yino to yanna be yayi yan gaskiyae naa yino Yi mae bavun gan Tsoci yi u la yiu ganudan Aljannao gan ni be za guruzhiy
 And for this their prayer hath Allah rewarded them with gardens with rivers flowing underneath- their eternal home Such is the recompense of those who do good,Ebo acino Soko ci gaa gba ebo egan naaagan na be Aljannazhi nazhi nuwanzhie je fi takoabo na amafi bo fi tutun yin Wuncin ga mayi egagba yan za nazhie jin bolobolo nao
 But those who reject Faith and belie our Signs- they shall be companions of Hell-fire,Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na acia aya Yi zhi yi ganmana na za wuncinzhi ga yi eyamancizhi yan ena jahimao
O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you but commit no excess for Allah loveth not those given to excess,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la eyan managizhi na Soko lajin halali ya ye na haramu ma ye mae ga gwo iyaka ganma Akika Sokoe wa za nazhie gwo iyaka gan naa
Eat of the things which Allah hath provided for you lawful and good but fear Allah in Whom ye believe,Ye mae gi dagan arziki na Soko laayaye na natso gayi halali uma yi lilici na ye mae sundan Soko na ye gan ye jin imani be yin na
 Allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths for expiation feed ten indigent persons on a scale of the average for the food of your families or clothe them or give a slave his freedom If that is beyond your means fast for three days That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn But keep to your oaths Thus doth Allah make clear to you His signs that ye may be grateful,Sokoa wan ye yea be kuti nazhi ye dazhi yan ti kpere naa ammaade wyuna wan ye be yanazhi ye ga ta kpankoro yeci zhi kuti na Ebo acino kafara kutizhi ganmana uyi yangici la ya ezagwagbagizhi guwo dagan mini yangici tatacin na yegi be iyali yezhi na ko ma ye la tufuwazhie yaae fan koma ye la wuzhie sa ulau zhe egi Gancin zana be de nanazhia na to ufe azum yan fo guta Wuncin ga yi kafara kutizhi yezhio ye ga kutizhi na Yemae tswa kutizhi yezhi acin ga ga Sokoe jin bayani ayauzhi ya ye yio ujinwo be wunciny ye yea jin yebo ya Soko

Satan´s plan is but to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer will ye not then abstain,Akika shetan de kpa gan wyunula ewunsun bedozhi to nanvo dozhi ulau laudan tsakani yebo be dozhi dan mini egyeo be cacae umau la ye yeu kan uke pipa Soko to swalla jinu lugwa To ye lugwa gancina

 On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness there is no blame for what they ate in the past when they guard themselves from evil and believe and do deeds of righteousness- or again guard themselves from evil and believe- or again guard themselves from evil and do good For Allah loveth those who do good,Le fi danbo ta eti za nazhiga imani jin aci lo tun wangizhi dan mini yan nazhi aga gi na boa abeke agafe za nazhi tswa Soko naa acia imani jin aci lo tun wangizhi na gancin aci kezhe tswa Soko aci jin bolobolozhi na Soko mae wa za nazhi gae jin bolobolo na
O ye who believe! Allah doth but make a trial of you in a little matter of game well within reach of game well within reach of your hands and your lances that He may test who feareth him unseen any who transgress thereafter will have a grievous penalty,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

O ye who believe! Kill not game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb If any of you doth so intentionally the compensation is an offering brought to the Ka´ba of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed as adjudged by two just men among you or by way of atonement the feeding of the indigent or its equivalent in fasts that he may taste of the penalty of his deed Allah forgives what is past for repetition Allah will exact from him the penalty For Allah is Exalted and Lord of Retribution,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food- for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game- as long as ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb And fear Allah to Whom ye shall be gathered backA egbe yan yankungi edu to yagiciu lajin halali ya ye ulaufe eyan emawou ya ye to ezan daci yezhi Ama egbe yankungi yan kin laajin haramu ta eti yebo abeke yega yidan haramio na Ye mae tswa Soko be dansunuyin ebo na wyun ga yi Etsu naa ku ye yekan zhi yegboro u bo nao,
Allah made the Ka´ba the Sacred House an asylum of security for men as also the Sacred Months the animals for offerings and the garlands that mark them That ye may know that Allah hath knowledge of what is in the heavens and on earth and that Allah is well acquainted with all things,Sokoa kaaba laafe kata Alfurma tsunwan yan kukuta yan adini ya zawangizhi to Etswa Alfurma to hadayazhi to hadaya nazhi a la yan -- koro na wuncinzhi ma ebo ye debae kpewo kede akika Soko yi be kpikpe yannazhifi sanmazhio na to yan nazhi fi kinbo na akika ma Soko yi be kpikpe yandondoeSurah  Know ye that Allah is strict in punishment and that Allah is Oft-forgiving Most MercifulYe mae kpe wo kede akika Soko Etsu na gbota azaba na bo uyioakika ma Soko Etsu gafara uyio etsu yegun uyioSurah  The Messenger´s duty is but to proclaim the message But Allah knoweth all that ye reveal and ye concealYan dondo ta eti Tuci boa saide eyan wu Soko ma kpe yan nazhi ye jin tula na to yan nazhie ye jin swiswoci na
Say Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle thee so fear Allah O ye that understand that so ye may prosper,Gan gan Eyan dede be eyan wangi aga fe ninia ka da ekundo yan eyan dede gae ya wyo shaawa na ebo acino e tswa Soko be dansunuyin ya ye nazhi yi eza ankalizhi na ujin wo be wunciny ye gade rabo
 O ye who believe! Ask not questions about things which if made plain to you may cause you trouble But if ye ask about things when the Qur´an is being revealed they will be made plain to you Allah will forgive those for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Forbearing,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

 Some people before you did ask such questions and on that account lost their faithAkika za nazhi shi yedzo na gbingan wuncinzhi leani ganci aci tinba baci na ajin bayaniyaa na a jin kafirinci be hukunci wuncinzhi,
It was not Allah who instituted superstitions like those of a slit-ear she-camel or a she-camel let loose for free pasture or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals or stallion-camels freed from work It is blasphemers who invent a lie against Allah but most of them lack wisdom,Soko la hukunci ndondo cici eti bahiraboa Rakum yiwo gigi naa kotukpa acie wo ya kuti na to saibatu rakum naa lo ya cie la wun kuti na eti wiwa nasarao na to waswilatu dabbanae wo ya kuti kamina rakum gaama gi ebazhi na to hamu rakum eba naa kpe gwa eti wiwo ya kutio na ammade zanazhia jin kafirinci na e tswa ganmana tswa ta Soko ekun dondo ma ade ankalia
 When it is said to them Come to what Allah hath revealed come to the Messenger They say Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following what! even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance,A ma ga gana gan E da beyn eba yan na Soko cin be na to eba Tuci Soko agan  Yan na yi tsun Yan manciyizhi kpe eti ubona kun yikea ni Ngba!

O ye who believe! Guard your own souls If ye follow right guidance no hurt can come to you from those who stray the goal of you all is to Allah it is He that will show you the truth of all that ye do,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Etswa eti tacin yezhiegun yan za na ga gbin nan wuna tswan ye yea ye ga fe eza bawuzhi naa kpata ma ezhe kebae dan eba Soko gancin ucia ya ye labari yan etun nazhi ye fe lona
 O ye who believe! When death approaches any of you take witnesses among yourselves when making bequests- two just men of your own brotherhood or others from outside if ye are journeying through the earth and the chance of death befalls you thus If ye doubt their truth detain them both after prayer and let them both swear by Allah We wish not in this for any worldly gain even though the beneficiary be our near relation we shall hide not the evidence before Allah if we do then behold! the sin be upon us!,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na!

 But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin of perjury let two others stand forth in their places- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right let them swear by Allah We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two and that we have not trespassed beyond the truth if we did behold! the wrong be upon us!,Amma aga bea kpedin ke zagubaba ajin lefi eri ganmana na to a wa za guba ndocizhi agikini kingibabo nazhi -- yin gan zamafari zhina acia la kutiazhi be Sokoe kede Hakika erijin yanyi ugboka gan erijin yana yi ma gbin iyaka tua yima gaa gbigbintu gaskiya to hakika yi gaa fe dan mini azwalumizhio
 But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin of perjury let two others stand forth in their places- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right let them swear by Allah We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two and that we have not trespassed beyond the truth if we did behold! the wrong be upon us!,Amma aga bea kpedin ke zagubaba ajin lefi eri ganmana na to a wa za guba ndocizhi agikini kingibabo nazhi -- yin gan zamafari zhina acia la kutiazhi be Sokoe kede Hakika erijin yanyi ugboka gan erijin yana yi ma gbin iyaka tua yima gaa gbigbintu gaskiya to hakika yi gaa fe dan mini azwalumizhio
That is most suitable that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths But fear Allah and listen to His counsel for Allah guideth not a rebellious people,Wuncin ga tsoba gaskiya gano na aga eri jin eti kendoe uga yi yi nao amaa sundan ebo abea kutizhi laa zheban da eba egun gicizhi ma baci yan kutizhiazhio ma Ye mae sundan Soko ye fe wogan Soko Hakika Sokoe la jamaa yan fasikizhi ke eko gurua
 One day will Allah gather the messengers together and ask What was the response ye received from men to your teaching They will say We have no knowledge it is Thou Who knowest in full all that is hidden,Efo na Soko ga ku Tucizhi yekan na gancin Ucia gan gan  Kila gwo ye mio Acia gan gan Kpikpe ndondo dan be yi yina akika wyo ga yi Etsu kpikpe yan yannazhia swo nao
 Then will Allah say O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother Behold! I strengthened thee with the holy spirit so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom the Law and the Gospel and behold! thou makest out of clay as it were the figure of a bird by My leave and thou breathest into it and it becometh a bird by My leave and thou healest those born blind and the lepers by My leave And behold! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from violence to thee when thou didst show them the clear Signs and the unbelievers among them said ´This is nothing but evident magic,Lokaci na Soko gangan Ya wyoe Isa egi Maryamu!

And behold! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and Mine Messenger they said ´We have faith and do thou bear witness that we bow to Allah as Muslims´,To kamina Mijin wahayi ya Hawariyuzhi na sahabi Annabi Isa zhi kede ye a imani jin be Mi yin to be Tuci Mi yin na Aci gan yi yia imani jin wyo mao la erio jin kede akika musulumizhi yi yio na
 Behold! the disciples said O Jesus the son of Mary! can thy Lord send down to us a table set with viands from heaven Said Jesus Fear Allah if ye have faith,Lokaci na hawariyuzhi gan gan Ya wyoe Isa egi Maryamu! Ngba Tsoci yan wyoe u gbo ka na wyuna cin yangici be ya yi wo dagan sanmao na Isa ci gan  yede tswa Soko be dansun uyin wuna yi muminizhi ye yio na
They said We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts and to know that thou hast indeed told us the truth and that we ourselves may be witnesses to the miracle,Aci gan yie wa gan yi gi dagan miniubo ebo to yangban yizhia lashi yi ma ykpe-ywo ke gaskiya wyo gan be yi yino na yi may lay fey ta eti ubo dan mini za nazhia eri jin na
 Said Jesus the son of Mary O Allah our Lord! Send us from heaven a table set with viands that there may be for us - for the first and the last of us - a solemn festival and a sign from thee and provide for our sustenance for thou art the best Sustainer of our needs,Isa egi Maryama ci gan Tsociyi!

 Allah said I will send it down unto you But if any of you after that resisteth faith I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one among all the peoples,Soko ci gan Akika mi gau cin be ya ye gancin zana gabea jin kafirinci baci wuncino miniebo na to akika miajinu azaba azaba iri na Mi laajin zandondo mini alittazhi boa na
And behold! Allah will say O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah´ He will say Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right to say Had I said such a thing thou wouldst indeed have known it Thou knowest what is in my heart Thou I know not what is in Thine For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden,To kamina Soko gangan Ya wyoe Isa egi Maryamu!

Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say to wit ´worship Allah my Lord and your Lord´ and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them and Thou art a witness to all things,Mi gan yando bea yina saide natso wyo jin mi foro be yin na kede ye jin bawtae ya Soko Etsu na yi Tsoci mi to Tsociye na mi maafe eri ta etiabo matuka yan lokaci na midan tacinabo na gancin na wyo gwo rayi be mi yin na wyo afe Etsu na fe tswa alamariazhina wyo mafe Etsu na ejin ri ta eti yandondo na
If Thou dost punish them they are Thy servant If Thou dost forgive them Thou art the Exalted in power the WiseWyo ga bea tsa ci jina azaba akika wuzhi wyozhi ayio wyo ma ga yi Etsu zankpeo to Etsu hikimao,
Allah will say This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth theirs are gardens with rivers flowing beneath- their eternal Home Allah well-pleased with them and they with Allah That is the great salvation the fulfilment of all desires,Soko ci gan yin na ga yi efo na gaskiya ajin za gaskiyazhi taimako nao Aljanna na nuwanzhie je fi tako shinabo na gaajin tabbata yaa Amaafibo fi tutun yin Sokoa yeda jin ganni bea yin atso ma yeda jin ganni be Sokoe Wuncin ga yi rabo na wancin nao
 To Allah doth belong the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein and it is He Who hath power over all things,Soko ga wun mulki yan sanmazhio to kin to yannazhi fi miniabo nao Soko ga ma yi Etsu nade kagbo ta eti yandondo nao
 Praise be Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light Yet those who reject Faith hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord,Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko Etsu na jin halitta samazhi to kin na Ucia bazhi kozhi tohaske laafe dan minia bo kanga gancin zanazhia jin kafirci be tsociayin na cie laa pan ke gaskiya lugwa
He it is created you from clay and then decreed a stated term for you And there is in His presence another determined term yet ye doubt within yourselves!,Wyin Soko gajin halitaye dagan mini egun bo gancin Ucia hukunci yan ajali yandondo ba to eka ajali na tso yi kokontsoko tso nadan be uyin na Kanga gancin yecie jin kelokezhin

 But never did a single one of the signs of their Lord reach them but they turned away therefrom,Aya ndondo nama ga be ya dagan mini Aya zankpe yan Soko Zhio na sai agabici keu lugwa

See they not how many of those before them We did destroy- generations We had established on the earth in strength such as We have not given to you - for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance and gave fertile streams flowing beneath their feet yet for their sins We destroyed them and raised in their wake fresh generations to succeed them,Kashi a le ye lea yan ekun dondo eza zaman nazhi Yi jina hallaka shiadzo naa Ngan yi yaa kagbo ta ti kinbo iri natso yi la ya ye yea na Yicia sanma yakpea etio Uci fedu eleko kpea Yicia eduzhi la cifeje fi takoazhio gancin Yicia jin hallaka ebo zunubi azhio Yici kezhea halitta yan zaman ndocizhi jin zumanabo
If We had sent unto thee a written message on parchment so that they could touch it with their hands the Unbelievers would have been sure to say This is nothing but obvious magic!,Daaci gan Yicin litafi cin bea ya wyoe dan mini takadao aciga egwazhi laa tou da zanazhia jin kafirinci na agan gan Na na de ufea sai de eyan ma naa tula na
They say Why is not an angel sent down to him If we did send down an angel the matter would be settled at once and no respite would be granted them,Aci gan ki-la aci cin malaika be ya wyuna yano Daacigan yi cin malaika cin be ga da Soko ga hukunci ba eti hallakaabo ganci ma a pata ndondo yaa
 If We had made it an angel We should have sent him as a man and We should certainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion,Daaci gan malaika ga Yi gafe Tucio da yi gau laazhe zawangi da ma Be aciny Yiga gigizhi laadan alamariubo yaa
Mocked were many messengers before thee but their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mockedAkika ma ala Tucizhi mi shidzo bedzo kafi wyo yo be na gancin za nazhi fela mi na yan nazhi afe lalami na cia cin ta,
Say Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth,Gan gan Efe dazan kpe eti kinbo gancin yecie cinele eoezhin kendoe zoba yan ganmana zuncizhi yi yi na
Say To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth Say To Allah He hath inscribed for Himself the rule of Mercy That He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment there is no doubt whatever It is they who have lost their own souls that will not believe,Gan gan Ngba yan nazhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo na ziI wuno Gan gan  Soko wuno Umayegun laajin tiile ta eti tacinubo Akika ma ugae ku yekan kpata da efo Alkiyami kelo kezhin ndondo ma dan wuncin boa Za nazhi maajin hasara yan eti tacina na to a wuncinzhi ajin imania
To him belongeth all that dwelleth or lurketh in the night and the day For he is the one who heareth and knoweth all things,Wyin Soko ga ma wun yan dondo naahi tsuyin dan mini yeshio ko yigidio nao Etsu nae wo yandondo na Etsu na yi be kpikpe yandondo na
 Say Shall I take for my protector any other than Allah the Maker of the heavens and the earth And He it is that feedeth but is not fed Say Nay! but I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah in Islam and be not thou of the company of those who join gods with Allah,Gangan Ngba zandoci na jin Soka na uga mia la Ndakatao alali ma wyun ga ca jinjin alitta yan sanmazhi to kin yino Wyun ga mae ya yandondo cie giozando mae yau gia Gangan Akika mi ajin mi foro gan min lanfe kakan ca yan za naata kpatsun ya Soko na ye mae gaafe dan mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci na ma
Say I would if I disobeyed my Lord indeed have fear of the penalty of a Mighty DayGangan ,Akika mie sundan azaba yan Efo wanciko-ko abeke miga le foro Tsoci mi ba na
On that day if the penalty is averted from any it is due to Allah´s mercy And that would be Salvation the obvious fulfilment of all desire,Zandondo na ga azaba pan keu lugwa fo wuncin na to akika Soko a za wuncin gunyeazo Wuncin ga ma yi robo yan egwagan naa la tu nao
If Allah touch thee with affliction none can remove it but He if He touch thee with happiness He hath power over all things,Soko ga egun ndoci laatswan wyoe zando ci danbo lau keyabo woa saide wyun tso Uma ga alheri ndoci laaya wyoe to wyun de Etsu Uyio na de iko ta eti yandondo na
He is the irresistible watching from above over His worshippers and He is the Wise acquainted with all things,Soko ga yi Etsu na kagbo yan kangi dan da eti wunzhiuzhi bo na Wyun ma Etsu hikima uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio
 Say What thing is most weighty in evidence Say Allah is witness between me and you This Qur´an hath been revealed to me by inspiration that I may warn you and all whom it reaches Can ye possibly bear witness that besides Allah there is another Allah Say Nay! I cannot bear witness! Say But in truth He is the one Allah and I truly am innocent of your blasphemy of joining others with Him,Gangan Ngba kiI wancin gan eba eri jin bo Gan gan Soko tsayi Erio dan tsakani mi bo be ye yino Ama jin wahayi ya mi yan Alkuranu nana ebo min la wyun jin ye gangba to za nazhi egan nana gaa tun bana Ngba Ye yea jin ri be akikae kede ade tsoci ndoci naa panba be Sokoe na na ajin bauta ya na Gangan Mia jin ri wuncina Gangan Akika de Tsoci niniketw tsa ajin bauta yao mi ma akika mia egwa wa be yan nazhi ye la pa Soko baci nae
 Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe,Zanazhi Yi la litafi ya na ekpeu ye kendoe ekpe egi mimaciazhi ye na Za nazhi ma ga asara laatwan eti tacina na to za wuncinzhia jin imania
 Who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or rejecteth His signs But verily the wrong-doers never shall prosper,ZiI ga ti binakun a gan za na da tswa ganmana cia ta Soko nao ko ma ucia aya Soko yi ganmanna nao Akika binakun ticzhi a de nasaraa
One day shall We gather them all together We shall say to those who ascribed partners to Us Where are the partners whom ye invented and talked about,Fo na Yi gaa kua yekan baenio na gancin Yi cia gan ya za nazhi layan pa Soko baci na gan Biibo za nazhi ye fe lajin -- to na dano
 There will then be left no subterfuge for them but to say By Allah our Lord we were not those who joined gods with Allah,Gancin fitinaa ci fea saide dan mini egan naagan gan Wallahi Tsoci yi yi jin za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci naa
Behold! how they lie against their own souls! But the lie which they invented will leave them in the lurch,Cinle kendoe atsoe zun ganmana ta eti tacina na yannazhi atswa yan ganma na na cia cina bo
Of them there are some who pretend to listen to thee but We have thrown veils on their hearts So they understand it not and deafness in their ears if they saw every one of the signs not they will believe in them in so much that when they come to thee they but dispute with thee the Unbelievers say These are nothing but tales of the ancients,Ama de dan miniabo nazhia fe shitukpa ya wyoe na Yi ma eyan laakpea yangbanazhio acie de fahimta yan egan Soko bea tukpazhi maa te E wogan Soko bea Aya yan egwa wu zankpe Soko ndondo na ma aga le ye na ajin imani beu yina har ma kamina aga be eba wyoe na ajin afe gbomi be wyo yin Nazhia jin kafirinci na cia fe gan gan Nana de ufea saide ecin yan za mafarizhi
 Others they keep away from it and themselves they keep away but they only destroy their own souls and they perceive it not,Acie kan zazhi emi la tu Soko be Tuciy acie lakpeya be jin jin imani be u yin Umajin zandondo e jin hallakaa sai de eti tacina tsoamae wo sansan wuncina
If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say Would that we were but sent back! Then would we not reject the signs of our Lord but would be amongst those who believe!,Da acigan wyoe leaye kamina a kana gikini eti enao na acia gan gan Kasa yi re! Daaci gan aga yiye rayi dan daa izhe yi maa kara yi aya ndondo yan Tsoci yi ganmana bea yi ma gafe dan mini muminizhio nazhia gaskiya ya be Sokoe na
 Yea in their own eyes will become manifest what before they concealed But if they were returned they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden for they are indeed liars,A a yanna danbo na akika yanna afe so shidzo batsozhio na wuna tula yaa Ka ama ga ye rayidan lo izhe akika a kezhe da eti etun nazhi a kana yi lo na Akika ma ganmana-zuncizhi a yio
And they sometimes say There is nothing except our life on this earth and never shall we be raised up again,Aci gan Rayiuyi yandoa sai de edunfe yan izhe kawanyin yima jin zanazhi a la nakin baci ajalio naa
If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say Is not this the truth They will say Yea by our Lord! He will say Taste ye then the penalty because ye rejected Faith,Daaci gan wyoe leaye le lokaci na akana gikini eba Tsocia bo na Uci gan Asa nana jin gaskiyaa Aci gan Acingao yimae zhi kuti be Tsoci yi yin! Uci gan E fe fin azaba ebo etun nazhi ye lo yan kafirinci na
 Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah- until on a sudden the hour is on them and they say Ah! woe unto us that we took no thought of it for they bear their burdens on their backs and evil indeed are the burdens that they bear,Akika za nazhia ganmana laadan alamari yan gunguna be Sokoe na ajin hasara harda lokaci na alkiyami ga be ya kpaketeyin na acia gangan Kasa ro-- nkpe yi re! eti yan nazhi yi lugwa ci jina na! Atso ma ga kara zunubiazhi kukpe zunmaazhio Oo kara nama a la yan zunubi na wuna biye
What is the life of this world but play and amusement But best is the home in the hereafter for those who are righteous Will ye not then understand,Edunfe izhe ma ufea sai de edzo be shagalae akika ma emi yan zoba ude alheri gan ya za nazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundauna Kashi ye de ankali dea
We know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee It is not thee they reject it is the signs of Allah which the wicked contemn,Akika yi kpewo ke de egan nazhie da gan na wune nyin wyoe yangban na To akika a yi wyoe ganmannazunci yangbanazhi boa ammaade azwalumizhi de egbo mi gbo be aya Soko Zhiy
Rejected were the messengers before thee with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs until Our aid did reach them there is none that can alter the words and decrees of Allah Already hast thou received some account of those messengers,Akika ma a yi Tuci zhi ganmana zuncizhi shi wyodzo leani acie hankuri jin ta eti yanna a yia gan ganmanna zunci na ama jina egun harda lokaci na taimako be be yana za ndondo ma la egwasan dan hukunci Soko woa Akika ma ngan labari ndocizhi yan Tucizhi be ya wyo yea ni
 If their spurning is hard on thy mind yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign- what good If it were Allah´s will He could gather them together unto true guidance so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance and impatience!,Wyo ma gae le ye gan cice lebaa be wyo yin wuna gbota fi wyoe to uga ye jin ya wyoe da wa yan na wyo gaa da lo kin na koma ekpa ndoci na wyo ga da lo sanma na ebo wyo la aya zankpe ndoci obe o yaa a kokari jin Be ma wuna ba Soko ba uga kuyekan kpata ta eko bawuo Ebo acino wyo yeo ga lugwa wyoa fe dan mini jahilizhio ma
Those who listen in truth be sure will accept as to the dead Allah will raise them up then will they be turned unto Him,Akika de za nazhi gae shi tukpa ganni be hankalina a gae -- gano zanazhi ma ga tsuani na Sokoa bea la nakin aci ga la zheba da tsunU
They say Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord Say Allah hath certainly power to send down a sign but most of them understand not,Aci gan Kii la aci cin aya zankpe be yau dagan eba Tsociu boa yino Gangan Akika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio na wyua cin aya beyin na ammaade ekundondoazhi ade kpikpea
 There is not an animal that lives on the earth nor a being that flies on its wings but forms part of communities like you Nothing have we omitted from the Book and they all shall be gathered to their Lord in the end,Amade dabba ndondo dan mini kin nana boa ama de elugi eyan fufungi naefu be gwapauzhi naa sai de atso jamazhi ayio dozhin iri nyan ye Yi ma ya yandondo ye dan mini Litafi nna boa gancin ma eba Tsociabo akua yekanzhio

 Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb- in the midst of darkness profound whom Allah willeth He leaveth to wander whom He willeth He placeth on the way that is straight,Za nazhi maa aya Yi zhi yi ganmana na tukpa tencizhi ayio edingizhi ma ayio fi mini bazhikozhio Zana ga ba Soko na ugau ya yanu gun egbino zana ma ga bau na u gau laafe ta eti eko gboro

 Nay- On Him would ye call and if it be His will He would remove the distress which occasioned your call upon Him and ye would forget the false gods which ye join with Him!,Ngan Soko gbaugi ga ye yeafe yi yeo U ci ga yanna ye laa yiu yena laake yabo yaye uga bau na yeci ga yannazhi ye laa pau baci na ba tan
 Before thee We sent messengers to many nations and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity that they might learn humility,Akika ma Yi tun Tucizhi fi alummazhi nazhi be shiwyodzo na agwo gana ebo acino yicia wan be ebayibazhi be eyan gunzhi watakila be wunciny a dakpya ya Soko
When the suffering reached them from us why then did they not learn humility On the contrary their hearts became hardened and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them,To ebokiibo kamina azaba bayiba Yi zhi be etiana aci dakpyaa yano Ammade yangbanazhi cia gboka shetan cia etun dede nazhie lo na laapanin fia
 But when they forgot the warning they had received We opened to them the gates of all good things until in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts on a sudden We called them to account when lo! they were plunged in despair!,Gancin kamina abea tanba laa lo dan yannazhi ala sanatu na Yicia ekozhi kpe yaa yan yandondo har da kamina afe fayangban eti alfario be yannazhi ala yana yi cia wan winwan yan giriku kanga ma acindan hali dede yan gigizhi boa ni
 Say Think ye if Allah took away your hearing and your sight and sealed up your hearts who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you See how We explain the signs by various symbols yet they turn aside,Gan gan Kashi ye le yea Soko ga gwo ganwo ye to bacinle yezhi be ye yin Ucia eyan laata yangban yezhi Tsoci kici danbo baci Soko naalauzhin be ya ye nao Cin kendoe yie la ayazhi be yaa kakayin na le gancin ma elaa panke eko guru lugwa
 Say Think ye if the punishment of Allah comes to you whether suddenly or openly will any be destroyed except those who do wrong,Gan gan Ye lr ye lea azaba yan Soko gadabe yaye kpa keteyin be girikui koma gbangbae ngan Sokoa jin zandondo hallakaa sai de jamaa nazhi gayi azwalumzhi na
 We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn so those who believe and mend their lives- upon them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Yimae tun Tucizhi tuntuna sai de ebo abea ya za guruzhi buhsara amaajin za dedezhi gangba Ebo acinozana gabea imani jin na ucia bolobolo laadan etunuzhio na to dansun ndondo danbo yaa amaale yangban nyin ye a
But those who reject our signs- them shall punishment touch for that they ceased not from transgressing,Zanazhi ma aya Yizhi zankpe Soko yi ganmana na azaba Soko gatoa ebo etun nazhi afe lo yan fasikancizhi na
Say I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah nor do I know what is hidden nor do I tell you I am an angel I but follow what is revealed to me Say can the blind be held equal to the seeing Will ye then consider not,Gan gan Mia gan ya ye gan edzunba yan arziki Soko zhi dan be mi yina Mi ma de kpikpe yan naa swo na mi maagan yaye gan malaika mi yia Mide lamitu yandondoa sai de yanna aga jin wahayiu be yami na Gan gan Ngba yebonci be za nae leba ye na gazhe yeni Kashi ye kpaye kpaa
Give this warning to those in whose hearts is the fear that they will be brought to judgment before their Lord except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor that they may guard against evil,Wyo mao la wunojin gangbao ya zanazhi gae sundan yan kuku naakua yekan lo eba Tsocia na ade Ndakata ndoci zunmau boa zando madanbo naa tangwaa naa watakila a tswa Soko ama sundan U
 Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening seeking His face In naught art thou accountable for them and in naught are they accountable for thee that thou shouldst turn them away and thus be one of the unjust,Wyo mao ga nyan za nazhie yi Tsocia ye to lazhin to lozuny acie wa yarda Soko za na ma aala egagba yan etuna ndondo gbin wyo yaa amaala egagba yan etun wyoe ndondo gbina Ebo acino wyo ga nyana to wyo gafe dan mini azwalumizhio
Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others that they should say Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful,Acinga gamao Yi jin sashiazhi fitina be sashiazhi ebo adebaagangan Ngba za nanazhi ga Soko la falala ya mini yibo Asa ujin Soko tsa kpe gan mini wuzhiuzhio za nazhi gae jin yebo yau naa
 When those come to thee who believe in Our signs Say Peace be on you Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself the rule of mercy verily if any of you did evil in ignorance and thereafter repented and amend his conduct lo! He is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Kamina ma za nazhia imani jin be aya Yizhi na gabe eba wyo na to gangan Aminci yan Soko ulaujin tabbatauta etiyebo Tsociye wyuna yegun laajin tiile ta etiubo ke de zandondo naga lotun dede miniebo eti rakpebo na gancin uci bea tuba jin zunma wuncino tadzu na to akika Soko Etsu gafara Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio
Thus do We explain the signs in detail that the way of the sinners may be shown up,Acinga ga ma Yi ye kpe ayazhi ri kaka yino to ebo ma eko yan lefi jincizhi ulau tuula
 Say I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon Say I will not follow your wain desires If I did I would stray from the path and be not of the company of those who receive guidance,Gan gan Akika mi a kan mi gan minga jin bauta ya za nazhi yejin bauta ya zuma Soko na ma Gan gan Mia lami tu etun yangban yezhia ebo na miga jin acin akika miga gbin Kanga ma mia fe dan mini eza bawuzhi boa
Say For me I work on a clear sign from my Lord but ye reject Him What ye would see hastened is not in my power The command rests with none but Allah He declares the truth and He is the best of judges,Gan gan Mi ta eti hujjakozhi na febe dagan eba Tsoci mibo na ye mau yi ganmana Yanna ma ye dinye gan ala be nahukunciu dangwa mi boa hukunci de undana sai be Sokoe wyune ya labari gaskiya wyun ga ma yi Etsu na gan za nazhi man yan kperi kpata nao
Say If what ye would see hastened were in my power the matter would be settled at once between you and me But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong,Gan gan Akika daaci gan yan na ye din yeuna be mi yin udano akika da aga hukunci ba tsakani mi bo be ye yinani Soko tsa ma kpe gano yan yanna azwalumizhi dany ninbo nao
With Him are the keys of the unseen the treasures that none knoweth but He He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge there is not a grain in the darkness or depths of the earth nor anything fresh or dry green or withered but is inscribed in a record clear to those who can read,Ebau bo gabo giyekozhi yan eyan swiswoci kpata fio zandondo ma kpea yea sai wyun tso Uma yi be kpikpe yan yannazhi kpe eti kinbo kpata na to nazhi fi mini eduo na fini ndondo maacin cici kinboa sai de kpikpea wuna dan be u yin amaade eyan sunsungi dan mini bazhiko kin zhi boa ko eyan funfuru ko wiwocia sai de a fi mini litafi ndocio nae jin bayania na
 It is He who doth take your souls by night and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day by day doth He raise you up again that a term appointed be fulfilled In the end unto Him will be your return then will He show you the truth of all that ye did,Wyunga mae gwo rayi yezhi be yeshi yino u ma yi be kpikpe yan yannazhi ye dajin be igidiina gancin ma uga ye laanakin mini ubo ebo hukunci ndoci yan lokaci nayi kikaci na gancin ma ebau gabo ezhekeba yedano gancin ucia yaye labari etun nazhi ye fe lo na
He is the irresistible watching from above over His worshippers and He sets guardians over you At length when death approaches one of you Our angels take his soul and they never fail in their duty,Wyun ga mayi Etsu na zankpeu wuna rukpe eti wuzhiuzhio nao U mae tun malaika etswazhi fia harda lokaci na ajali gabe ya zaeni miniebona Tuci Yizhi cia -- rayi beayin amae ya ye dan alamari wuncin boa
 Then are men returned unto Allah their protector the only reality Is not His the command and He is the swiftest in taking account,Gancin aci gaa ku zheban da tsun Soko Ndakataa yan gaskiya tso E shi tukpa! Wyun ga wun hukuncio wyun ga ma yi Etsu na fan gan eba egagbao nao
Say Who is it that delivereth you from the dark recesses of land and sea when ye call upon Him in humility and silent terror ´If He only delivers us from these dangers we vow we shall truly show our gratitude´,Gan gan Zie gwo ye tswa dagan mini bazhiko kin zhio to edu zhibo Yecia jin ye fe yiu be ekpyadae to swiswoci kede ugayi wadzun dagan mini mimacinle nanao akika yigafe dan mini zanazhie jin yebo Soko na
Say It is Allah that delivereth you from these and all other distresses and yet ye worship false gods!,Gan gan Soko ga wa yedzun dagan miniabo to dagan yangbanyin ndondo gancin yecie la yan pa Soko baci
 Say He hath power to send calamities on you from above and below or to cover you with confusion in party strife giving you a taste of mutual vengeance - each from the other See how We explain the signs by various symbols that they may understand,Gan gan Wyin Soko ga de Iko na wyuna tun azaba fi ye dagan etitayebo nao koma dagan tako bici yezhio koma wyune zhekeba kpere-kpere Uci fe ya sashiezhi masiba yan sashi zhi fin Ngba cin le kendoe yie jin bayani ayazhi kakayin na watakila ajin fahimta egan nazhie gan bea yin na
But thy people reject this though it is the truth Say Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs,Jamaa yan wyozhi ma a egan wyoe yi ganmana wuncin ga mayi gaskiyao Gangan Mi de jin wakili ta eti yeboa
Labari ndondo de ekpegiba bele yin ma yea be de kpikpe,
 When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme If Satan ever makes thee forget then after recollection sit not thou in the company of those who do wrong,Wyo ma ga be le za nazhie dzomi fi aya Yizhi na ye to a kpe ya ebaabo har sai aga lo dan egan ndocio najin wuncina na Uma gabea jin faruwa gan shetan yan tanba laace tu wyoe to ga kara fedun baci sinsantuo be jamaa nazhi yi azwalumizhi na ma
 On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous but their duty is to remind them that they may learn to fear Allah,Egagba yan lefi ndondo yan za na nazhie dzomi fi aya Soko na uta eti zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundanu naboa ammaade sinsantu danbo ya atso ujinwo atso wuncinzhi gaafe za nazhia tswa Soko cia sundanu na
Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world But proclaim to them this truth that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts it will find for itself no protector or intercessor except Allah if it offered every ransom or reparation none will be accepted such is the end of those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts they will have for drink only boiling water and for punishment one most grievous for they persisted in rejecting Allah,Zanazhi ma a adinia la eyan edzo be shahawa izhe na harma izhe cia ta na a ya yana wyo deo la Alkuranuo sanatu Ebo abea rayi ladan hallakao be etun gwaatso zhima Ndakata ndondoa danbo ya baci Soko boa zando ma danbo a tangwa yaa A ma ga ga yandondo de cia sa tia a gwo keu gwa Za wuncinzhi ga kauna ba be yegun Sokoe ebo etun dede nazhia lo na ade nuan yipa ndoci fin be azaba na tan sarauyin na ebo etun kafirinci nazhi afe lo na
Say Shall we indeed call on others besides Allah- things that can do us neither good nor harm- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from Allah - like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool wandering bewildered through the earth his friends calling come to us´ vainly guiding him to the path Say Allah´s guidance is the only guidance and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds,Gan gan Ngba yia yi yandociye eba bauta jino zunmaci Soko yan najin yi anfania umaajin yigun woa na acia la yi yia laadazhin eti ekpa dede nayi kpetiabo le na baci na Soko a yi lake ekoani na ke zana shetanzhiupa ci kinbo ucia gizhi na uma yi be eyazhi nazhie yiu zhin eko gboro na dabe eba yi yi Gangan Akika bawu yan Soko uga yi bawuo Ama jin yi foro gan yi la kpatsuny taiya Etsu naepke alittazhi kpata na
Say Shall we indeed call on others besides Allah- things that can do us neither good nor harm- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from Allah - like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool wandering bewildered through the earth his friends calling come to us´ vainly guiding him to the path Say Allah´s guidance is the only guidance and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds,Gan gan Ngba yia yi yandociye eba bauta jino zunmaci Soko yan najin yi anfania umaajin yigun woa na acia la yi yia laadazhin eti ekpa dede nayi kpetiabo le na baci na Soko a yi lake ekoani na ke zana shetanzhiupa ci kinbo ucia gizhi na uma yi be eyazhi nazhie yiu zhin eko gboro na dabe eba yi yi Gangan Akika bawu yan Soko uga yi bawuo Ama jin yi foro gan yi la kpatsuny taiya Etsu naepke alittazhi kpata na
 To establish regular prayers and to fear Allah for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together,Ye mae la swallae kue gi kini ye mae tswa Soko be emi latu forouyin wyunga maa kuye yekan loba wyuno
 It is He who created the heavens and the earth in true proportions the day He saith Be behold! it is His word is the truth His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown He knoweth the unseen as well as that which is open For He is the Wise well acquainted with all things,Wyun ga majin alitta yan sanmazhio to kin be gaskiya yino to efona wyunabe gan gan A fe yandondo cia fe fe na Eganu gayi gaskiyao mulki kpata wyun wuno efo na agae be efe fi mini kafo na Etsu na wun kpikpe yannaaswo na to naatula gbangbae na wyun ga mayi Etsu hikimao Etsu kpikpe
Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar Takest thou idols for gods For I see thee and thy people in manifest error,To kamina Ibrahima gan be babau Azarae na Ngba wyo ga kutizhi la Tsoci na wyoa fe jin bauta ya na Akika mide le wyo ye to jamaa yan wyozhi dan mini egbino naatula na
So also did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the earth that he might with understanding have certitude,Acinga ga Yi fe la mulkikozhi yan sanmazhi to kin wu Ibrahimao ebo ma ulau feuda mini za nazhia gaskiya ya nao
 When the night covered him over He saw a star He said This is my Lord But when it set He said I love not those that set,Kamina yeshi be ala kpeuna utaye le tswangi ndoci ye uci gan Nana gayi Tsoci mi yino kamina ubea kya na ugan Mie wa yan nazhie kya naa
 When he saw the moon rising in splendour he said This is my Lord But when the moon set He said unless my Lord guide me I shall surely be among those who go astray,Gancin naube le etswa yea la tinya na ugan Nana gayi Tsoci mi yino kamina ubea kya be na ugan Akika ka Tsoci mi wu mi baa akika mi gafe dan mini za gbingbinci zhio
When he saw the sun rising in splendour he said This is my Lord this is the greatest of all But when the sun set he said O my people! I am indeed free from your guilt of giving partners to Allah,Kamina ube le igidi ye a la tinya na ugan Nana gayi Tsoci mi yino nana ga wancin gano Gancin na ubea kya na ugan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! Akika mi egwa mi yinawa be yannazhi ye laapa Soko baci nae
 For me I have set my face firmly and truly towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I give partners to Allah,Akika mi yina fuska mi zhe wu Etsu na ca jinjin sanmazhi to kin na mi ma kansan ya da eba bauta yan gaskiya mima dan mini za nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na boa
 His people disputed with him He said Come ye to dispute with me about Allah when He Himself hath guided me I fear not the beings ye associate with Allah Unless my Lord willeth nothing can happen My Lord comprehendeth in His knowledge all things Will ye not yourselves be admonished,Jamaa yanuzhi ci gbomi beu yin Ugan ye ye gbomigbo be mi yin eti alamari Soko alali ma Sokoa ma wubani Mi mae sundan yan nazhi ye laapa Soko baci naa yando maajina sai de yan na ga ba Tsoci mi na Kpikpe yan Tsocimi ma wuna ma yandondo kezhe Kashi ye ye kpaye kpaa
How should I fear the beings ye associate with Allah when ye fear not to give partners to Allah without any warrant having been given to you Which of us two parties hath more right to security tell me if ye know,Ke wuna yi yi na mia fe sundan yan na ye laapa Soko baci nao ye mae sundan gan ye la eyan pa Soko baci be yan na acin hujja ndondo be yaye etiubo na yino mini jamaa gubaba bo gwoyin gan naade aminci Soko gannao ye ga fe gan yede kpikpe nao
 It is those who believe and confuse not their beliefs with wrong - that are truly in security for they are on right guidance,Za nazhia imani jin na imaniazhi ma bo keba be zwalunci yina na zawunci zhi aminci Soko gaajin tabbata yaa a ga mayi eza bawuzhio
That was the reasoning about Us which We gave to Abraham to use against his people We raise whom We will degree after degree for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge,Wuncin ma ugayi daliliko yizhio yimau laaya Ibrahima ta eti jamaauzhio Yi mae la zana gaba yi natu be darajazhi Akika Tsoci wyoe Etsu hikima uyio Etsu ilimi uyio
We gave him Isaac and Jacob all three guided and before him We guided Noah and among his progeny David Solomon Job Joseph Moses and Aaron thus do We reward those who do good,Yima twarya yau be egi Ishaqae to Yaa kubu kpata ma yia wuba to Nuhu yiu wuba shidzo batsozhiodagan mini zuriauzhio ma Dawuda danbo to Ayuba to Yusufu to Musa to Haruna acinga gama yie la egagba ya zanazhi gae lotun wangizhi nao
And Zakariya and John and Jesus and Elias all in the ranks of the righteous,To Zakariyau to Yahaya to Isah to Ilyasu kpata dan mini za guruzhio
And Isma´il and Elisha and Jonas and Lot and to all We gave favour above the nations,To Ismaila to Alyasau to Yunusa to Lutu to atso kpata yia ya daraja ta eti alittazhio
 To them and to their fathers and progeny and brethren We chose them and we guided them to a straight way,To dagan mini Babaazhio to Zuriyaazhio to yegiazhio Yimaala fe eza tsitsaci zhi yi cia wuba lo eko natso yi gboro na
This is the guidance of Allah He giveth that guidance to whom He pleaseth of His worshippers If they were to join other gods with Him all that they did would be vain for them,Wuncin ma bawu yan Soko uyio wyune lau wu zana gabau na ba mini wuzhiu zhio Daaci gan ala yandoci pa Soko baci da yannazhi afe jin kpata na ga nyin ya
 These were the men to whom We gave the Book and authority and prophethood if these their descendants reject them Behold! We shall entrust their charge to a new people who reject them not,Za wuncinzhi ga yi za nazhi yi la Litafi ya nao to hukunci annabci Za nanazhi gaajin kafirinci beuyin to akika yiu laaya jamaa ndocizhi nazhiajin kafirinci beuyina na
Those were the prophets who received Allah´s guidance Copy the guidance they received Say No reward for this do I ask of you This is no less than a message for the nations,Zawuncin zhi ga Soko wubao ebo acino fe sana ye be bawua yin Gangan Mi ma gbin yegan yan laada ndoci etiuboa wyin Alkuran de fea sai de sinsantu ya alittazhi kpata
No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say Nothing doth Allah send down to man by way of revelation Say Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought- a light and guidance to man But ye make it into separate sheets for show while ye conceal much of its contents therein were ye taught that which ye knew not- neither ye nor your fathers Say Allah sent it down Then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling,A ma la tsunwan ya Soko eti hakki yan tsunwan nagwou yin naa kamina a gan gan Soko cin yan dondo be ya zawangi ndondoa Gangan Zii cin litafi na Musa be beyin ucia fe haske be bawuI ya zawangizhi ye cie lau fe takadazhi ye lau tu ye mae swo na dokun nao Ama wu ye yanna yede kpikpeana to ye to Babaezhiio Gangan Soko Gancin wyocio laao yaodan dzolo-dzolozhinabo a fea dzo-dzo
 And this is a Book which We have sent down bringing blessings and confirming the revelations which came before it that thou mayest warn the mother of cities and all around her Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this Book and they are constant in guarding their prayers,Nana ma Litafi uyio yi cinucin be be albarkae umae ya litafi nazhi be shiudzo na gaskiya eboma wyo la wuno fe sinsantuo ya nna yan alkaryazhi kpata Makka to nazhi mau -- ba na Zanazhi ma imani jin be Efo Alkiyami na e jin imani be Alkuranui za wuncin zhima e la tswitswa dan salla zhi
Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against Allah or saith I have received inspiration when he hath received none or again who saith I can reveal the like of what Allah hath revealed If thou couldst but see how the wicked do fare in the flood of confusion at death! - the angels stretch forth their hands sayingYield up your souls this day shall ye receive your reward- a penalty of shame for that ye used to tell lies against Allah and scornfully to reject of His signs!,Zii ma ga wuye naagan yan za na tswa ganmana ta Soko nao ko ma uci gan A jin wahayi be ya mi alali ma ajin wahayi yandondo ya wyua nao to za na gan Mitsoa cin Litafi be yn iri natso Soko cin be nao Daaci gan wyoa leye kamina azwalumizhi gaalo dan mini hali nagban yan ajalio na kanga malaikazhi ci gaa egwazhi ta acia fe ganagan E wa tiedzun tinya hali nanao nyinna de a gae gba ga be azaba egbae ebo egan nazhi ye fe da gan eti Soko namajin gaskiyana ye maa fe za nazhie gbotika be aya Soko zhi na
And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time ye have left behind you all the favours which We bestowed on you We see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs so now all relations between you have been cut off and your pet fancies have left you in the lurch!,Akika ma ye kezhe dabe eba Yi yiani zaeninni kendoe yi jin alittaye tun dagan kakancae na Ye ma kara nazhi yi laayaye bagwa na yazhi zunma zunma yezhi boani Yi ma le egwatanci yezhi ye be ye yina nazhi ye lawu ke agae pa Soko baci yaye yeonaa Akika yandondo adzaya tsakaniyebo be dozhi yina ni yannazhi ma ye lawu cie petu na kpata agbin ye ye boa ni
 It is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout He causeth the living to issue from the dead and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living That is Allah then how are ye deluded away from the truth,Akika Soko gayi Etsu nae kpe eyi-sunsun misun cie tinya nao to kwosun wyune la eyan be rayi tinya dagan mini eyan tsutsucio umae la eyan tsutsuci tinya dagan mini eyan nayibe rayi na Zawuncin gayi Soko babo e pan ye lo beo
He it is that cleaveth the day-break from the dark He makes the night for rest and tranquillity and the sun and moon for the reckoning of time Such is the judgment and ordering of Him the Exalted in Power the Omniscient,Etsu nae la batin tinya na ucie la yeshi lashi tsuuyin na to yigidi to etswa ma acia fe yannazhie jin lisafi na Wuncin tsunwan dan uyio yan iko Etsu zankpe Etsu kpikpe
 It is He Who maketh the stars as beacons for you that ye may guide yourselves with their help through the dark spaces of land and sea We detail Our signs for people who know,Wyun ga ma la tswangizhi shishio ebo ye lae de bawu bea yin dan mini bazhikozhio to yan kin to eduo Akika Yi yia ayazhi kpeye ka ka yin be bayani ya zanazhi gayi eza kpikpezhi na

It is He Who sendeth down rain from the skies with it We produce vegetation of all kinds from some We produce green crops out of which We produce grain heaped up at harvest out of the date-palm and its sheaths or spathes come clusters of dates hanging low and near and then there are gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates each similar in kind yet different in variety when they begin to bear fruit feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof Behold! in these things there are signs for people who believe,Wyun ga mayi Etsu nae dule be dagan sanmao nao gancin yicie lau laa nyin yangici sunsunzhi irindondo tinya Yicie la tinya dagan miniubo na yi nuwan fini-fini na Yi cie wa yangici sunsun nazhi tu dozhi na to dagan mini dobinao dagan mini cigban gbereu zhiogwalagi dobinazhi nazhia labadozhi aci tsoba kin na danbo to batazhi yan sunsun inabizhi to emi zaytunizhi to rumanuzhi ade nazhi be dozhina to nazhi be dozhia na E cinle lo eba yangici sunsunu zhi kamina aga sun kpebo acia gyena Akika mini wuncinzhio kpata aya zhi yan egwa wu zankpe Soko danbo ya jamaa nazhi gae ya gaskiya be Sokoe na
 Yet they make the Jinns equals with Allah though Allah did create the Jinns and they falsely having no knowledge attribute to Him sons and daughters Praise and glory be to Him! for He is above what they attribute to Him!,A cia yandocizhi laapa Soko baci mini jannuzhio wyun Soko gama jin alittaao A cia egi bagizhi to yinzagizhi saaya Soko eti rakpe bo Lili kpata ajin tabbata yau!

To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth How can He have a son when He hath no consort He created all things and He hath full knowledge of all things,Etsu na ca jinjin yan sanmazhi to kin na Ke wuna yiyi uci degi nao alali ma ude yinmi ndondoa naa yino wyunga ma jin alitta yandondo nao Soko ma Etsu uyio na yi be kpikpe yandondoe na

 No vision can grasp Him but His grasp is over all vision He is above all comprehension yet is acquainted with all thingsBayeleszhi eyezhi a leuye woa wyun ma wyune le bayelezhi kpata ye Wyun ma Etsu tosayi uyio Etsu kpikpe,
Now have come to you from your Lord proofs to open your eyes if any will see it will be for the good of his own soul if any will be blind it will be to his own harm I am not here to watch over your doings,Akikaeyan yekpazhi be yaye dagan eba tsoci yebo to zana ga be shi tsuuyin uci kpaye na to wuncin yi ebo tiubo zana maga bayeleu na uci kpayea na wyuntso ga wuna yao mi majin zanaafe tswa ye tswa za naa
 Thus do we explain the signs by various symbols that they may say Thou hast taught us diligently and that We may make the matter clear to those who knowAcinga gama yie zhe ayazhi gwao ebo ma a gangan ,Wyo gba katun nna gba litafi ndocio ebo ma yi la wyunijin bayani ya jamaa nazhi gayi eza kpikpezhi na
 Follow what thou art taught by inspiration from thy Lord there is no god but He and turn aside from those who join gods with Allah,Amitu yan na aga jin wahayiu be ya wyoe dagan eba Tsoci wyobo na Ade yandondo naajin bauta ya na sai de wyuny wyo mao lao kpeo ya be zanazhie la yan pa Soko ba ci nae 
If it had been Allah´s plan they would not have taken false gods but We made thee not one to watch over their doings nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs,Umaa ba Soko ba daa ala yan pau bacia Yima la wyoe fe tatiabo gan wyo feo tswaao zaa Yima la wyo fe wakili ta eti aboahttps//playgooglecom/store/apps/detailsid=comnoorlabalquran
 Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides Allah lest they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings In the end will they return to their Lord and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did,Ye mae ga gi zanazhie wun yandoci ke Soko lugwa na toko ma kacina agi Soko toko eti ragbanzhi be rakpeboe Acinga ga Yila ninpa dan etun dede ya alumma ndondo gancin ma ezhekebaa uyi lo eba Tsocia Ucia yaa labari be iri etun nazhi afe lo na
They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that if a special sign came to them by it they would believe Say Certainly all signs are in the power of Allah but what will make you Muslims realise that even if special signs came they will not believe,Ama zhikuti be Sokoda iyaka yan kutizhia zhi ke de akika aga imani jin beuyin na gangan Hakika zankpe dan be zandondo yina sai be Sokoe Zhimaa ya ye hakikao ke de ayazhi gabe yaa jin imania yino
 We too shall turn to confusion their hearts and their eyes even as they refused to believe in this in the first instance We shall leave them in their trespasses to wander in distraction,Yi mae zhe yangbanazhi ban ke fahimta wangi lugwa kendoe de tun dagan caba batso zhio a yegan ajin imania na Yicia ya gun mini pipeazhio acia gizhi
 Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy- evil ones among men and jinns inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception If thy Lord had so planned they would not have done it so leave them and their inventions alone,Acinga gama Yila ezananvozhi makinzhi mini shetan yan zawangizhi to jannuzhi a fe ya Annabi ndondo sashizhi cie jin wahayi ya sashi be egan dede nazhia panin naeti de etao Uma gaba Tsoci wyo ba da atsoa jin wuna eboacino a ya be ganmana nazhie tswa nae
 To such deceit let the hearts of those incline who have no faith in the hereafter let them delight in it and let them earn from it what they may,To ebo ma yangban yan za nazhi jin imani be efozoba yina na ulau kanuda ebabe tukpa shiy eboma ala yedaajin beayin ebo ma adebaajin lefi nazhi agaajin na
 Say Shall I seek for judge other than Allah - when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book explained in detail They know full well to whom We have given the Book that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth Never be then of those who doubt,Ngba zandoci zunma Soko ga miada waza naajin hukunci eti edun fe izheo nao alalima wyunga yi Etsu na cin litafi be ya ye nae kpe ganzhi ye kakayin nao Zanazhi ma yi la litafi ya na e-kpeuye kede eba Tsoci wyobo acinube be gaskiya yinona eboaino ga fe dan mini zanazhie jin kelokezhin nao ma
 The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice None can change His words for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all,Egan yan hukunci Tsoci wyo ma wuna gunmiani be gaskiyae be adalinci zandondo danbo naala egwasan dan hukunciuzhi wo naa wyun ga ma yi Etsu nae wo nao Etsu kpikpe
 Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth they will lead thee away from the way of Allah They follow nothing but conjecture they do nothing but lie,Wyoma ga-mi tu kundondo za nazhi kpe eti kinbo na agao gbin ke eko Soko lugwa Ade yandondoe lamitua saide yekpa amade yandondoe jina sai ganmana
 Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His way He knoweth best who they are that receive His guidance,Akika Tsoci wyoe ga kpe gano yan zanazhie gbin ke ekou lugwa nao wyun ga ma kpe gano yan zanazhia ke eko gboro nao
 So eat of meats on which Allah´s name hath been pronounced if ye have faith in His signs,Ye mae fe gi dagan mini eyanzunzunci na aga tun sunna Soko ye ta etiubo na yegafe gan ye ya imani jin be atau zhi na
Why should ye not eat of meats on which Allah´s name hath been pronounced when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you - except under compulsion of necessity But many do mislead men by their appetites unchecked by knowledge Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress,Ki-ma jin ye yeo yecia gi yanna atun sunna Soko ye ta eti uboa na yino alalima wyuna eganzhi kpe ye ya ye kaka yin yan nazhi ulaji haramu na ya ye yeani nao Saide ena tiilebo ga bea de ye lo ebau na akika ma ekundondo zazhi e-kuzazhi fi egbino be etun yangbanazhi eti rakpe bo Akika Tsoci wyoe ude kpikpe gan yan yanna gbugbu kecizhie jin na
Eschew all sin open or secret those who earn sin will get due recompense for their earnings,Ye mae ke gan be lemba Sokoe to yan gbangba to yan swiswoci Akika zanazhie cewo lemba Soko na a gaa gba be iri yannazhi a fe jin na
Eat not of meats on which Allah´s name hath not been pronounced That would be impiety But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them ye would indeed be Pagans,Ye mae ga gi dagan mini eyan zunzunci naa tun sunna Soko ye ta etiuboa na ma akika wuncin fasikanci uyio Akika ma shetanzhi ajin a fe jin wahayi e gan dede lo eba masoyiazhi ebo a deba agbomi be ye yin Ye ma ga bea mitua akika yegaa fe zanazhie layan pa Soko baci na
Can he who was dead to whom We gave life and a light whereby he can walk amongst men be like him who is in the depths of darkness from which he can never come out Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing,Ngba za naafe eyan tsutsuci na ganci Yiciu dan rayi Yici ke zhea haske laayau na wyua fe la dazan dan tacin zawangizhiona ngba zawuncin gaazhe ye ni be dozhinu na gun mini bazhikozhio nama wyuna dzun boa na Acinga ga e-la ninpa dan etun dedezhi ya kafirizhio
Thus have We placed leaders in every town its wicked men to plot and burrow therein but they only plot against their own souls and they perceive it not,Acinga ga ma Yi laufe dan alkarya ndondo bo gbangban yan dzoshiciazhi aga yi lefi jinci gbonta zhio ebo adeba pa makirinci dedezhi a dan miniubo a maade makirinci dede naapa naa sai de naagia tso rayizhi naatso mae wo sansan wuncina
When there comes to them a sign from Allah They say We shall not believe until we receive one exactly like those received by Allah´s messengers Allah knoweth best where and how to carry out His mission Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah and a severe punishment for all their plots,Kamina ma a ya gabe yaa nae wu zan kpe Soko na a gan yi yia ajin imania sai aga be yayi be iri yannazhi alaya tuci Soko zhi na Soko ga ma kpe gan iri bana wyune la etun yan tuci dan nao Bele yin egbagi ndocizhi dagan eba Soko be azaba na de tsanani na wuna dea ebo iri makirinci dede nazhi afe jin na
 Those whom Allah in His plan willeth to guide- He openeth their breast to Islam those whom He willeth to leave straying- He maketh their breast close and constricted as if they had to climb up to the skies thus doth Allah heap the penalty on those who refuse to believe,Ebo acino zana Soko gae kpa gan wyuna lau ke eko na Uga yan gbanu laa fe gwi gwoci ya musulunci zana ma ugaakpa ci gan wyuan yaugun egbino na uga yangbanu lazhe pinpinci uci gyiku ke wyoa gan gan wyune gun sanma gun na Acinga ga Sokoa jin ula shikan kpe eti zanazhie jin imani a nao
This is the way of thy Lord leading straight We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition,Nana gayi ekpa Tso ci wyoe nayi gboro nao Akika Yia ayazhi kpe ye kakayin ya jama nazhie gwo sinsantu na
For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord He will be their friend because they practised righteousness,Zawuncizhi Ayi be emi yan aminci dan eba Tsocia bo wun ga ma yi Ndakataao ebo iri etun nazhi afe lo na
 One day will He gather them all together and say O ye assembly of Jinns! Much toll did ye take of men Their friends amongst men will say Our Lord! we made profit from each other but alas! we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us He will say The Fire be your dwelling-place you will dwell therein for ever except as Allah willeth for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge,Fo na ma Ugakua yekan baenio na Wyuna gan gan ya ye jama yan jannuzhi!

Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other because of what they earn,Acinga ga ma Yia jin Yeiela edzoshi yizhe yan sashi azwalumizhi a dan sashiazhi gwabo ebo iri etun dede nazhie lo na
O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you setting forth unto you My signs and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours They will say We bear witness against ourselves It was the life of this world that deceived them So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith,Ya ye jamaa yan jannuzhi to zawangizhi! Asa Tucizhi be yaye dagan mini yeboa acie ya labari yan aya Mizhi ya ye yea acie na ye wun eti gungun nyan ye be efo ye nana yina A cigan yi de jin ri ta eti tacin yi tso Ema nyan edun fe yizhe cia ta Acia eri ya ta eti tacina tso kede be akikae a ya fe kafirizhi na
The messengers were sent thus for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong-doing men´s habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned,Wuncin maafe ebo na Tsoci wyoe wyunajin alkarya ndondo hallaka eti zwaluncio alali-ma jamaa yan kinzhi kpea yana
To all are degrees or ranks according to their deeds for thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do,Alumma ndondo ma uyi be darajauzhi dagan mini etun nazhi aga lo na Tsoci wyo ma ufe Etsu nae ya ye ke etun nazhi ye lo na lugwaa
Thy Lord is self-sufficient full of Mercy if it were His will He could destroy you and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors even as He raised you up from the posterity of other people,Tsoci wyo ma Etsu bagwo uyio na de ye gun na Uga bau Ugae fin ya baenio Ucia jin zandondo na ga bau na kendoe de ndocizhio kayin na
 All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass nor can ye frustrate it in the least bit,Akika yannazhi e la jin ye alkawali na akika wuna da be ye ma jin zanazhi gangwa naaSurah Say O my people! Do whatever ye can I will do my part soon will ye know who it is whose end will be best in the Hereafter certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosperGan gan Ya ye jamaa yan mi zhi! Efe lo tun eti hali nazhi ye ga kpetiu bo na akika Mi etun lo ci mi yio be le yni ma ye abe de kpikpe yan za na gawun emi yan zoba wangi na Akika de azwalumia tso guri alheri
Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle they assigned Him a share they say according to their fancies This is for Allah and this - for our partners! but the share of their partners reacheth not Allah whilst the share of Allah reacheth their partners ! evil and unjust is their assignment!,Acia kansan ndo ci laa shi shi ya Soko dagan mini yan na udzoyana nyan yan gi ci latizhi to dabbazhi naaci gan Nana ma yan kuti yizhi a yio Naga yi yan kutiazhina towuncine tun eba Soko a na ma gayi yan Soko na wuncina tun eba kutiazhi gwosun be bi bi wunajin tabbata ya hukunci nae jin na
Even so in the eyes of most of the pagans their partners made alluring the slaughter of their children in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion If Allah had willed they would not have done so But leave alone them and their inventions,Acinga ga ma yannazhie la pa Soko baci na a ninpa laadan ya ekun dondo mushirikizhi wuwu yan egi azhi ebo adebaala ajin hallaka amaala rikicia laadan adiniaboa yaa Umaaba Soko ba da ajin wuna eboacino adzun ganabo to yannazhie tswa yan ganmana na
And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo and none should eat of them except those whom - so they say - We wish further there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden and cattle on which at slaughter the name of Allah is not pronounced - inventions against Allah´s name soon will He requite them for their inventions,Amagan yannazhi fi gbako yan dabba nanazhio na tsitsaci uyio ya bagi yizhi uma yi eyan kinkanci haramu ya yinmi yizhi Uma ga fe eyan tsutsuciani to kpataa ga wuno sai Soko ma gawo gbata be eyeji dede nanae Akika wyuny Etsu hikima uyio Etsu kpikpe u yio
 They say What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved for food for our men and forbidden to our women but if it is still-born then all have share therein For their false attribution of superstitions to Allah He will soon punish them for He is full of wisdom and knowledge,Akika zanazhi san wawa cia egiazhi wu eti rakpebo na ajin hasara Acia arziki na Soko yana laajin haramu ya tia eti ganmana naatswa ta Soko na akika agbin ama fe zanazhi ke eko naa
Lost are those who slay their children from folly without knowledge and forbid food which Allah hath provided for them inventing lies against Allah They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance,Wyun ga ma yi etsu na ca jin jin cigban latizhi nao ndocizhi wunkpa be wuruzhi to ndocizhi nazhi de wurua na to dobinazhi to eyandzozhi nazhi yangiciazhia kperi be dozhi na to nazhi be dozhia na E gi dagan mini yangicisunsunuzhio kamina aga nyin tin ya na ye mae la hakkiuzhie wa fona ye ga da ku yangici lati na yemae ga nyin yangici ya ma Akika ma Sokoe wa za nazhi gae nyin yan naa
It is He Who produceth gardens with trellises and without and dates and tilth with produce of all kinds and olives and pomegranates similar in kind and different in variety eat of their fruit in their season but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered But waste not by excess for Allah loveth not the wasters,Mini dabbazhio ma ade nazhie la karazhi na to nazhi ye ta cici cie zun gi na egi dagan mini arziki na Soko la yaye nao ye mae ga lamitu ekpa shetan zhi ma Akika eza nanvo yan gbangba uyi ya ye yeo
 Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat eat what Allah hath provided for you and follow not the footsteps of Satan for he is to you and avowed enemy,Iri gutwota a yio dagan mini yan wurezhio ade guba amade guba dagan mini kingbagbazhio Gangan Ngba eba guba tso aga ulajin haramuo kashi yiwo guba tso kashi natso ewanzhi yan iri gubaba ga kuye kan etiubo na E ya mi labari eti kpikpeo wunayi eza gaskiyazhi ye yio na
Take eight head of cattle in four pairs of sheep a pair and of goats a pair say hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or the young which the wombs of the two females enclose Tell me with knowledge if ye are truthful,Dagan mini rakumizhio ade iri guba to mini nankozhio ade iri guba Gangan ngba eba guba tso uljin haramuo kashi yiwo guba kashi yanna ewan yan yiwo guba ga gunyekan eti ubo na Kashi ye danbodan eri jinci zhi kamina Soko jin ye wasi yanci ba nanae na Ngba zii jin zwalunci a gan zana tswa ganmana cia ta Soko ebo udebau gbin zawangizhi eti rakpebo nao Akika Sokoe la jamaa yan azwalumizhi ke eko wangia
 Of camels a pair and oxen a pair say hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or the young which the wombs of the two females enclose - Were ye present when Allah ordered you such a thing But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah to lead astray men without knowledge For Allah guideth not people who do wrong,Dagan mini rakumbo guba danbo dagan mini nankoma guba danbo Gangan Ngba ebazhi u lajin haramuo kashi yiwozhi kashi yannazhi ga kuyekan fi ewan yan yiwozhio na kashi ye danbo lokaci na Sokojin wasiyanci be nanae na To Ngba ziI ti binakun gan zanae tswa ganmana ta Soko ebo ugbin zawangizhi eti rakpebo nao Hakika Sokoe la jamaa nazhi gayi azwalumizhi na a ke ekoa
Say I find not in the message received by me by inspiration any meat forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it unless it be dead meat or blood poured forth or the flesh of swine- for it is an abomination - or what is impious meat on which a name has been invoked other than Allah´s But even so if a person is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits- thy Lord is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Gangan mi tsun dan mini yan naa jin wahayi ya mi na boa yandoci na yi haramu ta eti zanagi yangici ndoci naa saide ugazhe musari ko ma egya jijeci ko ma nakan kputsun to akika wuncin eyan gwosun uyio ko ma fasikanci naazun be sunna ndoci najin yan Sokoa na To zana tiile bo gabeude ujin be wiwa yan lenba Sokoa na uma jin eti gbingbintu doka Sokoa na to akika Tsoci wyoe Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
 For those who followed the Jewish Law We forbade every animal with undivided hoof and We forbade them that fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails or is mixed up with a bone this in recompense for their wilful disobedience for We are true in Our ordinances,Yi ma dabba ndondo na de eku na ko vundunu na laajin haramu ya yahudu zhi to mini nankozhio to nangizhio Yia emiazhi laajin haramu yaa sai de nazhi ga kpe eba zunmaazhio na ko ma kaya gbakozhio na ko ma na ga bo keba be tsukuny na wunci ga Yi yia gaa gbao ebo gbugbukeazhi bo Yi ma akika gaskiya ta cizhi Yi yio
 If they accuse thee of falsehood say Your Lord is full of mercy all-embracing but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back,To aga egan wyo yi ganmana gangan Tsoci ye Etsu yegun uyio nade bagwo na zandondo ma danbo kangwa azabau wo eti le fi jinczhi boa
Those who give partners to Allah will say If Allah had wished we should not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers nor should we have had any taboos So did their ancestors argue falsely until they tasted of Our wrath Say Have ye any certain knowledge If so produce it before us Ye follow nothing but conjecture ye do nothing but lie,Zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci naa gan gan Dawuna ba Soko ba yi yia la yan pau bacia to babayizhia Da yi ma ala yandondo jin haramu woa Acinga ga zanazhi shiadzo na zun-ganmanao har aci fin azaba Yi yio Gangan Kashi ye de kpikpe ndoci de dan be ye yin na yea lau tin ya be ya yi na Ye de lamitu yandondoa sai de zato ye ma fea saide ganmana zunci zhi
 Say With Allah is the argument that reaches home if it had been His will He could indeed have guided you all,Gangan Soko tsa wun hujja naakunke nao ebo acino da uga bau da ugae ku kpe eko bawu baenio
 Say Bring forward your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so and so If they bring such witnesses be not thou amongst them Nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat our signs as falsehoods and such as believe not in the Hereafter for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord,Gan gan Eku eri ezhi beyn nazhie jin eri ke Sokoa nana laajin haramu na To aga bea eri jin wyo ga jin ri beayin ma Wyomao ga lamitu etun yangban zanazhia aya Yi yi ganmana na ma to zanazhi ya gaskiya be efo zoba yinana acie lapan ke eko Soko lugwa na ma

 Say Come I will rehearse what Allah hath really prohibited you from Join not anything as equal with Him be good to your parents kill not your children on a plea of want- We provide sustenance for you and for them- come not nigh to shameful deeds Whether open or secret take not life which Allah hath made sacred except by way of justice and law thus doth He command you that ye may learn wisdom,Gangan E da be minngba yan nazhi Tsoci ye laajin haramu nan yaye ye ga la yandondo pa u baci eba bautao ma ye mae fe jin boloboloe ya yanmaci gubaba ye mae ga wu egi yezhi ebo yajio ma Yigae ya ye arzikio to ye to egi ye zhio yemae ga tsoba etun alfashazhi ma to na tula miniu bo na to naa swo na yemae ga wu rayi ndondo na Sokou lajin haramu nama sai de uga yi eti hakkio ke wyuntso wuzana wuncinzhi ga Sokoa jin ye wasiyancio ujin wo be wunciny ye gefe eza hankalizhi
And come not nigh to the orphan´s property except to improve it until he attain the age of full strength give measure and weight with full justice- no burden do We place on any soul but that which it can bear- whenever ye speak speak justly even if a near relative is concerned and fulfil the covenant of Allah thus doth He command you that ye may remember,Ye mae ga tso ba dukiya ekungizhi ma sai de eti eko na ga gyegan nao har sai ugaazhe eza naajin baligi na ye mae fe tswa eyan dan yezhi to eyan ma yezhi eyanmazhi be ada linciy Yi maejin rayi ndondo kpakaa sai de natso uga jin wo na yema gabe eganganzhi to ejin adalinci ka ugaafe yan dangiyezhi ye mae fe la alkawali Sokoe she wuncinzhi ga Sokoa jin ye wasiyancio ujin wo be wunciny ye ga santu
Verily this is My way leading straight follow it follow not other paths they will scatter you about from His great path thus doth He command you that ye may be righteous,Akikama nana gayi ekpa yan Mi natso yi gboro nao ebo acino yea emi tuu yemae ga ga lamitu ekpazhi ma kacana agae gan kpere kpere ke ekpa Soko lugwa Wuncinzhi ga Sokoe lajin ye wasiyyao ujin wo be wunciny yegafe za nazhie tswa Soko cie sundanU na
 Moreover We gave Moses the Book completing Our favour to those who would do right and explaining all things in detail- and a guide and a mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord,Gancin Yicia litafi laaya Musa nayi emingunci yan bolo bolo Soko ya za ndondo nagae jin bolo bolo na na mae kpe ganzhi ye ka kayin nyan yandondo na umayi bawu to yegun ujin wo be wunciny aga imani jin be gun gun naada gun be Tsocia yin na
 And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing so follow it and be righteous that ye may receive mercy,Nana ma litafi uyio Yicinu cin beyn be albarkae ebo acino yea emituu ye mae tswa Soko ujin wo be wunciny Sokoa gune ye
 Lest ye should say The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us and for our part we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study,Ebo yebe gan gan Akika de acin litafi cinbe ya jamaa yan ena guba yahudu be nasarae nazhi shi yi dzo nama Yi maafe za nazhi wo yandondo eti katun nae gba naa ma
 Or lest ye should say If the Book had only been sent down to us we should have followed its guidance better than they Now then hath come unto you a clear sign from your Lord- and a guide and a mercy then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth Allah´s signs and turneth away therefrom In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our signs with a dreadful penalty for their turning away,Ko ma ye fe gan gan Da ci gan yi acin litafi be yao da yi ga fe eza bawuzhi gana to akika bayanizhi be ya ye dagan eba Tsoci yebo to bawu to ye gun Ngba ziI gaafe azwalumi naagan za na aya Soko yi ganmana ci ke zhea pan ke bawu lugwa nao Bele yin Yi ga za nazhie pan ya ke aya Yi lugwa na wo gbata be azaba dede ebo pinpan nae pan ke aya Soko lugwa na
 Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them or thy Lord Himself or certain of the signs of thy Lord! the day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if it believed not before nor earned righteousness through its faith Say Wait ye we too are waiting,Ngba ki za wun cinzhie kao ngan sai de malaikazhia bea dzuna fia ko ma Tsoci wyo you dzunu be ko ma sashi yan zan kpe Tsoci wyo you be u yaa Fondondo na ma sashi yan egwa wu zan kpe aya Tsoci wye ga be yaa na rayi ndondo najin imani le shi boa na ko na cewo etun wangi dan imaniu boa na wuna jinu anfani ndondoa Gan gan Ezhi bo fe ka akika yi tso zanazhie kana yi yio
As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects thou hast no part in them in the least their affair is with Allah He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did,Akika za nazhia adiniazhi sa kpere kpere na aci azhe enaenazhi na wyo fedan miniabo be yandondo yina akikama alamari za wuncizhi dan be Sokoe ganci ucia yaa labari yan etun nazhi afe lo na
He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil no wrong shall be done unto any of them,Za ndondo na ga be be etun wangi nini na wyunade egagba yan bolo bolo har guwokotonci yan wuncin za na maga be be etun dede nini na to wyunade egeagbaa sai de iri dede naujin na Soko maajina zwaluncia
Say Verily my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight- a religion of right- the path trod by Abraham the true in Faith and he certainly joined not gods with Allah,Gan gan Akika mi de Tsoci mi wyuna mi wuba lo eko natso yi gboro na adini uyio na gikini wo ya yandondo na ekpa uyio yan Ibrahima na gaskiya gwo baenio na uma fe dan mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko bacina boa

 No partner hath He this am I commanded and I am the first of those who bow to His will,Ude za nae pau baci naa Be wunciny ga maajin mi foro miga mayi kakanca yan zanazhia kpatsun ta ya foro Soko nao
Say Shall I seek for my Cherisher other than Allah when He is the Cherisher of all things that exist Every soul draws the meed of its acts on none but itself no bearer of burdens can bear of burdens can bear the burden of another Your goal in the end is towards Allah He will tell you the truth of the things wherein ye disputed,Gan gan Ngba zandoci zunmaci Soko ga mia da la Tsocio alali ma wyun ga yi Tsoci yandondo Rayi ndondo maa cewoa sai de ya eti tacinu kara tso ndoci ma wuna la kara zandocia gan-cin-ma lo eba tsoci ye gabo ezheke ba ye dano Ucia ya ye labari yan yan nazhi ye fe ce dozhi le ba dan mini abo na
It is He Who hath made you His agents inheritors of the earth He hath raised you in ranks some above others that He may try you in the gifts He hath given you for thy Lord is quick in punishment yet He is indeed Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Wyun ga ma laye fe zanazhie gwogwa dozhi fi kinbo nao Ucia sa shi yezhi laa latu eti sashio be darazhi ebo umaye yeu cinu le dan mini yannazhi ula yaye nao Akika Tsoci wye Etsu na fan be jin jin azabaena uyio akikama Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun

But they wonder that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves So the Unbelievers say This is a wonderful thing!,Aaa dea jin mamaki na za na ajin gangbanan miniabo ufe beo nan kafirizhi ci gan nan nan de eyan mamaki u yio
What! When we die and become dust shall we live again That is a sort of return far from our understanding,Ngba Yi ga tsu yicia zhe jikannan a kezhea yi dan rayi be Ezhe ke wuncin maakpe ya be gashiyae

But they deny the Truth when it comes to them so they are in a confused state,U jinacina a dea gaskiya yi ganmanan kamina u be yaa nan amaafe fi mini alamarizhio nazhi yi be rikiciy na
Do they not look at the sky above them- How We have made it and adorned it and there are no flaws in it,Kashiy acin Sanma cin le ta fitia boa kendoe Yi tuu tu naa Yi ciu panin naa U ma san ban dondo boa naa
And the earth- We have spread it out and set thereon mountains standing firm and produced therein every kind of beautiful growth in pairs-,To kin nan Yi ta cici naa Yicia patizhi ce tau Yi cia yangici sun-sunzhi iri ndondo laa tin ya bo nanzhiy ma yi wangi nan

 And tall and stately palm-trees with shoots of fruit-stalks piled one over another-,To dobinazhi nanzhi wunkpa nan a ma yi be egizhi nazhi tati dozhio nan
As sustenance for Allah´s Servants- and We give new life therewith to land that is dead Thus will be the Resurrection,Ebo ulaufe arziki u ya wuzhizhi Yi maa ezhi nan yi tsutsuci na dan rayi be u yin Acinga ga ma dzun dzun tinya dagan kabaria yio
Before them was denied the Hereafter by the People of Noah the Companions of the Rass the Thamud,Jamaa yan Annabi Nuhu zhi a egan Soko yi ganmanan shidzo be dzo to jamaa yan -- ga Rassizhi to Samuduzhi
 The ´Ad Pharaoh the brethren of LutTo Aduzhi to Firauna to yegi yan Lutuzhi atso a egan Soko yi ganmanan,
 The Companions of the Wood and the People of Tubba´ each one of them rejected the messengers and My warning was duly fulfilled in them,To jamaa yan Annabi shuaibuzhi to Tubauzhi kpata a Tucizhi yi ganmanan azaba cia jin tabbata ta eti a bo
 Were We then weary with the first Creation that they should be in confused doubt about a new Creation,Kashi Yi yia gbakpan gba be jin jin yan za mafari zhiy Aa ade jin kelo kezhin jin dan yi ye jin yan alittazhio
It was We Who created man and We know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him for We are nearer to him than his jugular vein,Akika Yi gajin Alitta zawangio Yi ma kpe yan nanzhie je lo-zhin fi yangbanu bo nan Yi ma tso bau gan to edin nanzhi fi korou bo nan

The sentence will be Throw throw into Hell every contumacious Rejecter of Allah!-,Yea kafiri ndondo nan gaa gbo tika nan yeu ce gun enao
Who forbade what was good transgressed all bounds cast doubts and suspicions,Za nae la alheri kan zazhi nan za nae gwo iyaka Soko gan nan U mayi za nae jin kelo kezhin nan
Surah Who set up another god beside Allah Throw him into a severe penalty,Za naa tsoci ndoci laapa Soko baci nan e ceu da gun azabao nan yi tsun tsun nu na
His Companion will say Our Lord! I did not make him transgress but he was himself far astray,Sheitan nan yi eyau nan cia gan gan ya wyo Tsoci mi! u jin mi gbin wuna re ammade wuntso afe dan mini egbin nanakpe ya nan
He will say Dispute not with each other in My Presence I had already in advance sent you Warning,U gan E ga jin husuma yeboro Mi bop ma Mia gangba laashidzo ya ye eti azaba boa ni
The Word changes not before Me and I do not the least injustice to My Servants,Ezhe egan gba eba Mi boa Mi ma jin za nae jin wuzhi zwalunci naa
One Day We will ask Hell Art thou filled to the full It will say Are there any more to come,Efo nan Yi yia gan be jahannamae gan Ngba wyoa shea ni U cia gan gan kashiy a yia de ke re naa la be mi na
 A voice will say This is what was promised for you- for every one who turned to Allah in sincere repentance who kept His Law,Acia gana gan Nna ga yi yan nan e la jin ye alkawalinao a mau jin shiri ya zandondo nan gae dokun be zheke lo eba Soko nan u ma yi za nae tswa kaida yan Soko nan

There will be for them therein all that they wish- and more besides in Our Presence,Yan dondo nan a gae wa nan fi bo yaa bibe ma kezhe dan bo eba Yi bo be
 But how many generations before them did We destroy for their sins- stronger in power than they Then did they wander through the land was there any place of escape for them,Alummazhi danbo dokun nazhi shidzo nan Yi ajin hallaka zawuncinzhi gboka gana aci be a fe za nazhie za fi ezhizhio cie wa gwagan za nan
 Verily in this is a Message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and earnestly witnesses the truth,Akika mini wuncino sinsantu danbo ya zandondo nan ga de ankali nan Ucia tukpa shi ya egan Soko ganni be yangban nae gwo gan nae
We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in Six Days nor did any sense of weariness touch Us,Akika Yi jin alitta sanmazhi to kin to yan nanzhi fi tsakaniabo nan danmini efo gutswanayino wahala ndondo ma de yi yia
 Bear then with patience all that they say and celebrate the praises of thy Lord before the rising of the sun and before its settingA ankuri jin be egan nanzhi e gan nan wyo mao feo li Soko tsatsa yin be yebo jiny ya Tsoci wye kafi igidiu lau tinu ya nan be kafi igidi lo mi nan,
And during part of the night also celebrate His praises and so likewise after the postures of adoration,Mini yeshio ma fe liu tsa tsa yin wyo mao feo liu zunma yan salla ndondo
 And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out from a place quiet near-,Wyo mao feo shitukpa efo nan za nan kun zazhi yn yi nan U ga yia dagan bandoci nan tsoba na
 The Day when they will hear a mighty Blast in very truth that will be the Day of ResurrectionEfo nan alittazhia wo kabara yan gaskiya nan fo wuncin ga yi efo dzun-dzun tinya kabari bo,
Verily it is We Who give Life and Death and to Us is the Final Goal-,Akika Yi gae dan yan rayio Yi ga mae wu rayio eba yi ga ma alittazhia kezhe zhino
The Day when the Earth will be rent asunder from men hurrying out that will be a gathering together- quite easy for Us,Efo nan kin gala fi acia fe dzun tinya vayin nan wuncin gungun yekan u yio nan yi finfanci eba Yi bo nao
We know best what they say and thou art not one to overawe them by force So admonish with the Qur´an such as fear My Warning!,Yi ga de kpikpe gan eti yan nanzhi e gan nan bo wyo ma jin za nae jina kpaka naa Fela Alkuranu jin waazi ya za nan gae sundan azaba Mi nanBear then with patience all that they say and celebrate the praises of thy Lord before the rising of the sun and before its settingA ankuri jin be egan nanzhi e gan nan wyo mao feo li Soko tsatsa yin be yebo jiny ya Tsoci wye kafi igidiu lau tinu ya nan be kafi igidi lo mi nan

Woe to the falsehood-mongers-,Sokoa ganmanan zuncizhi bomi
Those who flounder heedless in a flood of confusion,Za nanzhi a ya ye dan igbe o izheo nan
They ask When will be the Day of Judgment and Justice,A cie gbin gan zan gan Ngba foci a alkiyamio
 It will be a Day when they will be tried and tested over the Fire!,Fo nan a gaa maacin le dede ta eti ena o nan
 Taste ye your trial! This is what ye used to ask to be hastened!,Efe fin fitinan ye tsozhi nan nan ga yi azaba nan ye fe din ye yan bibe u nao
As to the Righteous they will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs,Akika za nazhie tswa Soko nan a fi mini Aljannazhio be nuwan nanzhie je tinya nae
Taking joy in the things which their Lord gives them because before then they lived a good life,A tso guiri be yan nan Tsocia layaa nan Akika shidzo batsozhio a fe za nazhie jin bolobolo nan
They were in the habit of sleeping but little by night,A fe za nazhiy lokaci de gi mini yeshio u gae laa le le o nan
And in the hour of early dawn they were found praying for Forgiveness,Lokaci yan sahuru fafa gaajin ma ajin afe ba gafara
 And in their wealth and possessions was remembered the right of the needy him who asked and him who for some reason was prevented from asking,Mini dukiyaazhio ma etswa hakki yan za nae ba yan nan ganni be za nae wan miniu cie baa nan
 On the earth are signs for those of assured Faith,Mini kin bo ma a yazhi fibo yan sinsantu ya zananzhiy ga gaskiya ya nan
 As also in your own selves Will ye not then see,To mini eti tacinye tso ayazhi fi bo kashiy ye ba ye lea
And in heaven is your Sustenance as also that which ye are promised,Arziki yezhi ma to yan nanzhiy a jin ye alkawali nan u fi mini sanmao
Then by the Lord of heaven and earth this is the very Truth as much as the fact that ye can speak intelligently to each other,Mi ma zhi kuti be Tsoci yan sanma be kin yin akika alamari wuncin gaskiya uyio kendoe de ye kpemi cie gan gan nan
Has the story reached thee of the honoured guests of Abraham,Ngba eza yan ega Annabi Ibrahima tun eba wyo yia ni
 Behold they entered his presence and said Peace! He said Peace! and thought These seem unusual people,Ka mi nan a gandan ebaubo nan aci gan Aminci ulau jin tabbatau ya ye za nanzhiy yi kpea yea nan
Then he turned quickly to his household brought out a fatted calf,Uci san nin loeba iyaliuzhi uci be be soya yan nanko gigi nan nankan nan
And placed it before them he said Will ye not eat,Uciu laa tso baa U ci gan kashiy yea gia
 When they did not eat He conceived a fear of them They said Fear not and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge,U cia ya dansuna yin wo swiswoci Aci gan Ga sundan ma aci yau labari yangban fa yan egi bagi nan gaazhe Man nan
 But his wife came forward laughing aloud she smote her forehead and said A barren old woman!,Yinminu cia tin ya be ninmae ucia fuskau dan yan uci gan Ynzagi naa kuku u nae magia nan gbani tsa wuna be magio
They said Even so has thy Lord spoken and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge,Acigan A cinga ga Tsoci wyo gano akika Etsu hikima uyio Etsu kpikpe u yio
Abraham said And what O ye Messengers is your errand now,U ci gan Kiy yi akika yan nan la ye be nao Ya Tucizhiy
They said We have been sent to a people deep in sin-,Aci gan Akika a tun yi tun fi jamaa ndocizhi nanzhie jin lefi kpe kin bo nan

To bring on on them a shower of stones of clay brimstone,Ebo yi bey jina azaba be takunzhi yan lankpa nan yi yi pa nan
Marked as from thy Lord for those who trespass beyond bounds,Nanzhiy ma a jin alaamaazhi dagan nko yan Tsoci wyo bo nan ebo a laajin lefi jincinzhi azaba
 Then We evacuated those of the Believers who were there,Yi cia zandondo nan ga yi Mumini nan laatin ya mi nin bo
But We found not there any just Muslim persons except in one house,Yi ma tsun emi ndondo boa sai de emi nini nan yi yan Musulumizhi nan
But We found not there any just Muslim persons except in one house,Yi ma tsun emi ndondo boa sai de emi nini nan yi yan Musulumizhi nan
And We left there a Sign for such as fear the Grievous Penalty,Yima aya lugwa dan bo ebo ulau fe sinsantuu ya za nan zhi gae sundan azaba nan tan nan
 And in Moses was another Sign Behold We sent him to Pharaoh with authority manifest,To mini Musao Kami nan Yi tunu tun fi Firauna be hujja naa tula nan
But Pharaoh turned back with his Chiefs and said A sorcerer or one possessed!,U cia zuma ce ta ganni be jamaa yan uzhiy ucigan Eyan maci uyio ilanduci yio
 So We took him and his forces and threw them into the sea and his was the blame,Ebo acino Yi ciu wan to jamaa yanuzhi Yi cia ceya fi mini eduo wunsto cia fe za naa jin tacinu zargi nan
And in the ´Ad people was another Sign Behold We sent against them the devastating Wind,To mini labari Aduzhio aya danbo kami nan Yi tun efe tsuntsun-nu fia nan efe nan albarka dana nan
 It left nothing whatever that it came up against but reduced it to ruin and rottenness,Wyne lu yandondo nanuga keba be yin nan gwaa sal u gau laafe ke tsukun gwi gwoci nan
 And in the Thamud was another Sign Behold they were told Enjoy your brief day for a little while!,To mini labari Samuduzhio kami nan a gan ya gan Efe woma da eka degi nan
But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord So the stunning noise of an earthquake seized them even while they were looking on,Acia gbo tika be alamari Tsocia yin kabara dede cia wan atso ma fe cin ba le
 Then they could not even stand on their feet nor could they help themselvesAde kagbo kanga nan a ga a nankin naa ama de za nazhia jina Taimako naa,
To jamaa yan Nuhu zhio tso shidzo batso zhio aafe jamaa nan zhiy yi fasikizhi nan,
 With power and skill did We construct the Firmament for it is We Who create the vastness of pace,Sanma ma Yi tuutu be kagboe akika ma Etsu iko Yi yio
 And We have spread out the spacious earth How excellently We do spread out!,To kin yinotso ma Yi ga tau cicio Madalla be Etsu nan ta kincici parae nan
 And of every thing We have created pairs That ye may receive instruction,Yi ma eba be yiwoe jin dan mini yan dondo ebo ye lae Sane tu

And make not another an object of worship with Allah I am from Him a Warner to you clear and open!,Ega la tsoci ndoci a pa Soko baci ma akika gangba jinci naa tula nan u ga mi yi dagan ebau bo

So turn away from them not thine is the blame,Dzunganabo akika wyo jin za nan a jin zargi naa
But teach thy Message for teaching benefits the Believers,Wyo mao feo jin waazi akika wazi ejin muminizhi anfani
I have only created Jinns and men that they may serve Me,Mi ma jin alitta yan jannuzhi to zawangizhi ebo yandondo boa sai da ebo aajin bautaa ya mi
No Sustenance do I require of them nor do I require that they should feed Me,Mi wa arziki ndondo gwataa boa Mi ma wa gan a ya Mi yangicia gia
 For Allah is He Who gives all Sustenance- Lord of Power- Steadfast for ever,Akika Soko gayi Etsu arzikio Etsu nan gboka sarauyin nan
For the Wrong-doers their portion is like unto the portion of their fellows of earlier generations then let them not ask Me to hasten that portion!,Akika Zananzhi jin zwalunci nan zunubizhi ta etia bo iri zunubi nanzhi ta eti dozhina zhio nan ebo acino a ga din ye be azabae ma

 Verily the Doom of thy Lord will indeed come to pass-,Akika azaba yan Tsoci wyoe u gaajin tabbata
There is none can avert it-,Ade za nan kanu gwa wo naa
On the Day when the firmament will be in dreadful commotion,Fo nan Sanma gaa kun kun kun yan iyaka nan
 And the mountains will fly hither and thither,Patizhi ci ga ala ke ya bo baenio
Then woe that Day to those that treat Truth as Falsehood-,Azaba yan robonkpe u ga ajin tabbata ya ganmanan zun ci zhi
 That play and paddle in shallow trifles,Za nanzhi a cia dan edzo dzo baenio nan
 That Day shall they be thrust down to the Fire of Hell irresistibly,Fo nan a daagwa lo da fi ena ya jahannamao baenio nan
 This it will be said Is the Fire- which ye were wont to deny!,Acia gana gan Ngan nana ga yi ena na ye fe yi ganmanan nao
 Is this then a fake or is it ye that do not see,Ngba eyanma ga dan nao kashi ye leba ye lea
Burn ye therein the same is it to you whether ye bear it with patience or not Ye but receive the recompense of your own deeds,E gan fi bo yejin ankuri ko ma ye ga jin ankuri ma nini u yio ya yeo Akika a agaegba ga be iri etun nanzhi ye fe lo nan
 As to the Righteous they will be in Gardens and in Happiness-,Akika za nanzhie sundan Soko nan a fi mini aljannazhio be niimae
Enjoying the Bliss which their Lord hath bestowed on them and their Lord shall deliver them from the Penalty of the Fire,Acia fe woma be yan nan Tsocia la yaa nan Tsocia ma ga wadzun be azaba yan ena jahimuy
 To them will be said Eat and drink ye with profit and health because of your good deeds,Acia gana gan Efe gi ye mae fe fin be ninmae egagba wuncin yi ebo etun nanzhiy ye ce lo izhe o nan
 They will recline with ease on Thrones of dignity arranged in ranks and We shall join them to Companions with beautiful big and lustrous eyes,Aci ga kpetso gadozhio nanzhi yi titacizhi nan Yi vi ga yawo jin yaa be ynzagi aljannazhiy
And those who believe and whose families follow them in Faith- to them shall We join their families Nor shall We deprive them of the fruit of aught of their works Yet is each individual in pledge for his deeds,Za nan zhi a imani jin nan zuriyazhi cia mi tua eti imani jino nanyi ga ku keba be zuriyazhiy Yi maa ke etunazhi tukun a Zandondoa ga etun nanu ga lo nan laa kpe tsou
And We shall bestow on them of fruit and meat anything they shall desire,Yi maa kezhe twarya yaabe yangici mari marizhiy to nankan mini yannanzhi a gae de shaawau nan
They shall there exchange one with another a loving cup free of frivolity free of all taint of ill,A fe fin eyan managizhi atso be dozhiy fi miniu boa le fi jinma danboa
 Round about them will serve devoted to them young male servants handsome as Pearls well-guarded,Egi wawagi aljannazhi cia fe mae ke zhe wyo ga lea ye wyoa ye gan ko aluluI naa swo nan a yio
 They will advance to each other engaging in mutual enquiry,Saashiazhi ma a ga ye zhe wu sashi acia fe gbin dozhi gan
 They will say Aforetime we were not without fear for the sake of our people,A ci gan Akika Yi ya fe zhidzo ba tso zhio yi fe sundan Soko dan mini iyali yi zhio
But Allah has been good to us and has delivered us from the Penalty of the Scorching Wind,Soko cia eryatwau la aya yi yinnan U cia yi gangwa be azaba nan yi tsun tsun nunae
Surah  But Allah has been good to us and has delivered us from the Penalty of the Scorching Wind,Soko cia eryatwau la aya yi yinnan U cia yi gangwa be azaba nan yi tsun tsun nunae
 Truly we did call unto Him from of old truly it is He the Beneficent the Merciful!,Akika Yi ya tun izhe bastozhio yi fe ba gwagan be Sokoe Akika Etsu eryatwa uyio Etsu yegun uyio
Therefore proclaim thou the praises of thy Lord for by the Grace of thy Lord thou art no vulgar soothsayer nor art thou one possessed,Wyo mao feo jin waazi akika wyo jin eyan mancia wyo ma jin ilanduci be niima yan Tsoci wyo yina
 Therefore proclaim thou the praises of thy Lord for by the Grace of thy Lord thou art no vulgar soothsayer nor art thou one possessed,Wyo mao feo jin waazi akika wyo jin eyan mancia wyo ma jin ilanduci be niima yan Tsoci wyo yina
 Or do they say- A Poet! we await for him some calamity hatched by Time!,Kashiy e gangan gan enikoci u yi ebo acino yi fiituu ye be yan nan egbazhe dede yan zaman gi gun nan
Say thou Await ye!- I too will wait along with you!,Gan gan Efe tuye akika mi tso dan gan-ni be ye yin eba eyetuo
Is it that their faculties of understanding urge them to this or are they but a people transgressing beyond boundsKashiy ena nanazhi gae jina foro be nan nazhi yino Kashiy adea fe jamaa nanzhie -- iyaka Soko gan nan,
 Or do they say He fabricated the Message Nay they have no faith!,Kashiy egan-gan gan u tswau tswa Aa ade jin imani jina
Let them then produce a recital like unto it- If it be they speak the truth!,Wunayi acino aabe be egan ndoci na ga ade Alkuranu nan wunayi gaskiya tacizhi a yio nan
 Were they created of nothing or were they themselves the creators,Kashiy ujin eyan a jin alittaa yaa Kahiy atso tsae jin alitta dozhio
Or did they create the heavens and the earth Nay they have no firm belief,Kashiy a ga jin alitta yan Sanmazhi to kin yino Aa a de ya gaskiyaa
 Or are the Treasures of thy Lord with them or are they the managers of affairs,Kashiy edzunba yan arziki bea yin u dano kashi aga wun Iko ta eti zazhibo
 Or have they a ladder by which they can climb up to heaven and listen to its secrets Then let such a listener of theirs produce a manifest proof,Kashiy a yi be ekpae yi nan a tsoe a tsoe la wogan dagan sanmao nan gancin za nae wo gan be yaa na cie be yaa be hujja nanzhia latu nae
 Or has He only daughters and ye have sons,Kashiy Wuny Soko ga wun egi ynagizhio ye ci wun bagizhio
Or is it that thou dost ask for a reward so that they are burdened with a load of debt-,Kashiy Wyoe gbinagan lada gbin edu nan wyo la taa nan cia lukpin fia
Or that the Unseen in it their hands and they write it down,Kashiy ebaabo ga kpikpe swiswocizhi dano Ebo cano acie ka yan nanzhi ga baa nan
Or do they intend a plot against thee But those who defy Allah are themselves involved in a Plot!,Kashiy e pa makirinci ndoci pa Akika za nazhi ajin kafirinci nan atso ga egun yan makirinci a gio
Or have they a god other than Allah Exalted is Allah far above the things they associate with Him!,Kashiy a yi Tsoci ndoci yi baci Soko Lili kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko ke yan nazhi e la pau baci nan lugwa
 Were they to see a piece of the sky falling on them they would only say Clouds gathered in heaps!,Ama ga le kansan ndoci ye sanmao naa sa ya zhi kin nan a gan gan girgjezhio nan tu tati dozhio nao
So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs wherein they shall perforce swoon with terror-,Dzun gana bo har da fo nan a be gun be efoa yin naajina azaba danbo nan
 The Day when their plotting will avail them nothing and no help shall be given them,Fo nan tanadizhi wuna kunke yaa be yandondo yina nan a maade za naajina taimako naa
And verily for those who do wrong there is another punishment besides this But most of them understand not,Akika azaba danbo ya azwalumi zhi kayin ammade ekun dondoazhi akpea
 Now await in patience the command of thy Lord for verily thou art in Our eyes and celebrate the praises of thy Lord the while thou standest forth,A ankuri be hukunci yan Tsoci wyo yin akika etswa Yi dan be wyo yin wyo mao fe o li Soko ganni be yebo jin ya Tsoci wyo yin Kandondo nan wyo ga nankin nan
And for part of the night also praise thou Him- and at the retreat of the stars,!To mini yeshio wyo liu tsa tsa yin to ka mi nan tswangizhi ga zunma zheta nan
The Hour of Judgment is nigh and the moon is cleft asunder,Alkiyamia tso ba kpankpan yin to etswa maa la fi guba
But if they see a Sign they turn away and say This is but transient magic,A ma ga aya le ye a zunma zhetau a cia gan gan eyanmau yio naa gwogan nan
 They reject the warning and follow their own lusts but every matter has its appointed time,Aciu yi ganmanan acia emi tu etun yangbanazhi akika alamari ndondo nan Sokoe gan nan U ga ajin tabbata
 There have already come to them Recitals wherein there is enough to check them,Akika ma mini labari nanzhiy be yanan ade dan minia bo nanzhi yi yan waniko nan
Mature wisdom- but the preaching of Warners profits them not,Hikima u yio naa kunke nan ammade gangba jina anfania
Therefore O Prophet turn away from them The Day that the Caller will call them to a terrible affair,A dzun gan abo har da efo nan za nae yi zazhi nan U gaa yia lo yan doci nan yi eyan dede nan azaba
They will come forth- their eyes humbled - from their graves torpid like locusts scattered abroad,Eyeazhi gagba gba Wyoa ye gan ko borogizhio nan zhi a ga nan
 Hastening with eyes transfixed towards the Caller!- Hard is this Day! the Unbelievers will say,Acia fe din ye loeba za nae yia nan kafirizhi a fe gan fo ga gan Yinna nan nan efo nan lukpin nan uyio
 Before them the People of Noah rejected their messenger they rejected Our servant and said Here is one possessed! and he was driven out,Jamaa yan Nuhu zhiotso a tucizhi yi ganmanan aci fe sha fi u
Then he called on his Lord I am one overcome do Thou then help me!,Uci ba Tsociu aduwa gan akika a mi zankpe eboacino Soko jin mi taimako
So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth,Yicia eko yan Sanma zhi kpe be nuwan nan fe cinzhin be kagboe nan
 And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs so the waters met and rose to the extent decreed,Yici kezhea eya nuwanzhi kpe kinbo nuwanzhi cia keba eti alamari nan Soko a kpa a ni nan
But We bore him on an Ark made of broad planks and caulked with palm-fibre,Yicia wuntso la dan mini eyao naakan be katankozhiy be kwontoe nan
 She floats under our eyes and care a recompense to one who had been rejected with scorn!,Uci fe bici be etswa Yi yin wuncin ma egagba u yio yazandondo nan aga jin kafirinci beu yin nae
 And We have left this as a Sign for all time then is there any that will receive admonition,Yiciu laafe aya ko a de za nan a santu nan
 But how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning,Ngba ke nangban azaba Mi yi yi be gangba nae jinanan yi nao
 And We have indeed made the Qur´an easy to understand and remember then is there any that will receive admonition,Akika yi ya Aluranu laafe eyan finfanci ebo sinsantuo Ngba a de za naa gwo sin san tu nan
The ´Ad people too rejected Truth then how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning,Jamaa yan Aduzhi a Tuci yi gan manan Ngba ke nangban azaba Mi be gangba nanzhie jina nan yi yi nao
For We sent against them a furious wind on a Day of violent Disaster,Akika Yi tun efe nan wo nan Sarauyin nan fia dan mini efo nan wonan nao na mae lo ye be ena-woe nan
 Plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up from the ground,Wune gbin zawangi ya wyoa ye gan ko cigban dobinazhi a yio nanzhi gbin cici nan
 Yea how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning!,Ngba ke nangban yan azaba Mi yi yi be gangba nae jina nan yi nao
But We have indeed made the Qur´an easy to understand and remember then is there any that will receive admonition,Akika Yi Alkuranu laafe fanci ebo sin santu o Ngba ade za naa santu nan
The Thamud also rejected their Warners,Jama yan Samuduzhi a gangba nanzhijina nan yi ganma nan
For they said What! a man! a Solitary one from among ourselves! shall we follow such a one Truly should we then be straying in mind and mad!,Aci gan Gbani zae ni mini yi bo tsa yi yia be gbao Yi ma gaa jin acin yi yia fe dan mini egbino be wawaboe
Is it that the Message is sent to him of all people amongst us Nay he is a liar an insolent one!,Kashiy wuntsa a be tsa mini yi bo acia la wahayia ya wuno Aa u jin acina ganmanan zunci tsau yio U mayi eza dede

And ye the while sit looking on-,Kanga yecia fe cinbale gancin
 But We are nearer to him than ye and yet see not-,Yi ma tsobau gan ye ammade ye ye le yea
 Then why do ye not- If you are exempt from future account-,Ki lao wunayi gan ye yea fe za nanzhiy a woa gbataa nao
 Call back the soul if ye are true in the claim of independence,Yea rayi ye lazhiny wuna yi eza gaskiyazhi ye yio nan

Has not the Time arrived for the Believers that their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of Allah and of the Truth which has been revealed to them and that they should not become like those to whom was given Revelation aforetime but long ages passed over them and their hearts grew hard For many among them are rebellious transgressors,To gbani eka laakuna ya za nan zhia imani jin naa nan yangbanazhi gaa dakpya ya pipa yan Soko naa be yannanzhiy ucin be yan gaskiya naa maa gafe ke za nanzhia la Litafi ya shidzo batsozhio ucia jin fo fia yangban azhi cia wo kpakparae na maa Akika ekun dondo za wuncinzhi fasikizhi yio

 We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance of Right and Wrong that men may stand forth in justice and We sent down Iron in which is material for mighty war as well as many benefits for mankind that Allah may test who it is that will help Unseen Him and His messengers For Allah is Full of Strength Exalted in Might and able to enforce His Will,Akika Yi tun Tuci Yizhi tun be hujjazhiy Yi ma cin Litafi zhi yaa ganni be tsunwane ebo zawangizhia laa kua gikini be adalinci Yi ma kezhe cin yankpa be yaa miniubo kagbo tsuntsunnu danbo uma yi eyan anfani ya zawangizhi ebo Soko u lauwu za na gae jin Soko be Tuciu yin taimako swiswoci nan Akika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu zankpe

 Then in their wake We followed them up with others of Our messengers We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary and bestowed on him the Gospel and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves We did not prescribe for them We commanded only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah but that they did not foster as they should have done Yet We bestowed on those among them who believed their due reward but many of them are rebellious transgressors,Yici kezhea Tuci Yizhi gbaa zunmao Yicia Annabi Isa egi Maryamu gbaa zunmao be Yicia Litafi yan Linjeela laa yau Yicia tosayi be yeguny laadan yangban yan za nanzhia emi tuu nan Gwigwo gan iyaka dan mini ibadao ma e kpe ya be wunciny Yi ka wuncin ta etia boa sai de a fea wa yeda yan Soko A ma tswau kendo u gwoyin a tswau naa Yicia egagba wangi laa ya za nanzhia imani jin nan ekun dondo miniabo ma fasikizhi ayio

 That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever over the Grace of Allah that His Grace is entirely in His Hand to bestow it on whomsoever He wills For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding,Ebo za ba Litafi zhia kpea wo ke de a de kagbo ndondo eti eryatwa Soko boa nan akika ma eryatwa kpata be Soko yinu dano wune lau ya za nan ga bau nan akika Soko Etsu rryatwa uyio nan wancin nan

If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar calling them mothers they cannot be their mothers None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth And in fact they use words both iniquitous and false but truly Allah is one that blots out sins and forgives again and again,Za nanzhie jin zihari mini yebo be yinmiazhiy nan aajin afela yinminazhi san tatu be nnaazhi nnazhi yan akika a ga yi nanzhiy maa nao Akika a de gan gan dedezhi tinya misuno a mae zun ganmanan zun Akika Soko Etsu sauki uyio Etsu gafara uyio
But those who divorce their wives by Zihar then wish to go back on the words they uttered- It is ordained that such a one should free a slave before they touch each other Thus are ye admonished to perform and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Za nanzhiy ma ga zihari jin be yinmiazhiy nan acia jin ake dazhin eti egan nagan nan ke uyi acina na hukunci nan ta etiabo nan u ga yi gan a la wuzhi a ya gi shidzo kafi a la egwaatu yinmiazhi nan Wuncin ga yi yan nan e la jin ye waazi nao Soko ma yi be Labari yan etun nanzhi ye lo kpata nan
 And if any has not the wherewithal he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other But if any is unable to do so he should feed sixty indigent ones this that ye may show your faith in Allah and His Messenger Those are limits set by Allah For those who reject Him there is a grievous Penalty,Gancin za nan be dewuzhia nan u la azum yan etswa guba nanzhiy lamitu dozhi nanu fe kafiu la egwau tu yinmiu nan Gancin zanan be jin wuncin woa nan u la eza gwagbagizhi za shitau ya yanu gi Wuncin ma yi ebo ye la imanie jin be Soko be Tuciu yin iyaka to hukunci yan Soko zhi ga dano nao azaba na ma tan nan wunajin tabbata ya kafirizhi

 Seest thou not that Allah doth know all that is in the heavens and on earth There is not a secret consultation between three but He makes the fourth among them - Nor between five but He makes the sixth- nor between fewer nor more but He is in their midst wheresoever they be In the end will He tell them the truth of their conduct on the Day of Judgment For Allah has full knowledge of all things,Kashi wyo le ye gan Soko kpikpe yan yannanzhi fi sanmazhio to kinbo naa A de eza swiswoci tsakani za guta boa sai de Soko gaa fe nicia a maa yi za gutsun Soko gaafe tswanayin cia ka aga gbagba ganacin ko aci ganacin sai Wuna dan gancin Uciayaa labari yan etun nanzhi a lo nan efo alkiyamiy Akika Soko de kpikpe yan yandondo
 Turnest thou not thy sight towards those who were forbidden secret counsels yet revert to that which they were forbidden to do And they hold secret counsels among themselves for iniquity and hostility and disobedience to the Messenger And when they come to thee they salute thee not as Allah salutes thee but in crooked ways And they say to themselves Why does not Allah punish us for our words Enough for them is Hell In it will they burn and evil is that destination!,Ngba Wyo le za nanzhi a kana gan a aga baza swiswoci na ma yea Gancin aci kezhe eti yannan akana gan a ga jin na ma a cie baza swiswoci eti le fio be gbin gbin tuy be lemba yan Tuciy A ma ga be ebawye a fe sa wyo mi be yan nan Soko la sa wyo yea nan acia fe gan dan yangbanazhio gan ki la Soko ci jin yi azaba ebo yannanzhiy yi ye gan nan boa yino jahannama danbo nan a gandan nan akika zobabiye

 Secret counsels are only inspired by the Evil One in order that he may cause grief to the Believers but he cannot harm them in the least except as Allah permits and on Allah let the Believers put their trust,Akika ezabaswiswoci eti lefio dagan eba Sheitan bo wune fe beo ebo yangban yan zananzhia imani jin nan ulau nyin u ma jina egun ndondo woa sai be izini Sokoe Soko ga ma Muminizhi a ya kpe kawan yino

O ye who believe! When ye consult the Messenger in private spend something in charity before your private consultation That will be best for you and most conducive to purity of conduct But if ye find not the wherewithal Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kami nan ye gabaza be Tuciy nan yea sadaka laa shidzo be-dzo Wuncin ga yi alheri ya ye yeo u ma tadzu gan Kagan ye be dea akika Soko Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegun u yio
Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation with him If then ye do not so and Allah forgives you then at least establish regular prayer practise regular charity and obey Allah and His Messenger And Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Kashiy ye sundan sun yan yaji ye ga sadaka laa Shidzo kafi ye baza nan Kagan ye be jina Soko cia fa be ye yin yea swallah ku gikini ye mae la zakkae wa ye mae la mietu Soko be Tuci uyio akika Soko de labari etun nanzhiy ye lo nan

 They have made their oaths a screen for their misdeeds thus they obstruct men from the Path of Allah therefore shall they have a humiliating Penalty,A kuti nanzhiy e zhi nan la ke garkuwa nan acia eko Soko kaneza yn da azaba yan zunyesun wuna jin tabbata yaa

Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred For such He has written Faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow to dwell therein for ever Allah will be well pleased with them and they with Him They are the Party of Allah Truly it is the Party of Allah that will achieve Felicity,Wyoa tsun jamaa nanzhia imani jin be Sokoe be efo zobae nan a fe de cincin ya za nae le Soko be Tuciu yin ba naa ka agafe mimaazhi ko egiazhi ko yegiazhi ko dangiazhi Za wuncin zhi ga Sokoa imani jin tabbata dan yangbanazhi bo U ci kezhea ya kagbo dagan nkou bo uma gaa la gandan aljannazhio nanzhiy nuwanzhie je fi takoshinu bo nan baga boa fi tutun yino Sokoe yeda jin bea yin atso maa jin be Sokoe Za wuncinzhi ga yi za ba Soko akika ma za ba Soko zhi gaade nasarao

It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering of the forces Little did ye think that they would get out And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the Wrath of Allah came to them from quarters from which they little expected it and cast terror into their hearts so that they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers take warning then O ye with eyes to see!,Wun ga nyan kafirizhi mini zaba Litafizhi tin ya dagan emiazhi bo ebo gungun yekan yan mafari bo Ye yan ebankoazhi gaa a kangwa wo be Sokoe Soko ci dzunfia banan akpaye tua nan Ucia edo laace dan yangbanazhio atso ci fe ban emiazhi ya egwaazhi ganni be egwa Muminizhiy e fe kpa ye re ya nanzhi yi eza hankali zhi nan

That is because they resisted Allah and His Messenger and if any one resists Allah verily Allah is severe in Punishment,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan a le Soko be Tuciu yin ba nan zandondo na ma gaa le Soko ba nan Soko Etsu tsun tsunnu u yio
Whether ye cut down O ye Muslim!

 What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger and taken away from the people of the townships- belongs to Allah- to His Messenger and to kindred and orphans the needy and the wayfarer In order that it may not merely make a circuit between the wealthy among you So take what the Messenger assigns to you and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you And fear Allah for Allah is strict in Punishment,Yan nan zhiy Soko ga nasarau laa ya Tuciu mini alkaryazhio nan Soko wun dan miniu bo to Tuciu to za nanzhiy tsoba nan to ekungizhi to eza gwa gbagizhi to ezan daci ebo dukiya beazhe yan nae dan yi dangwa ewodecizhio nama Yandondo nan Tuci ga la cia ya ye nan yea emi tuu yan nan ma u ga kane yin jin nan yea kpe ya beu yin ye mae fe sundan Soko akika Soko Etsu azaba nan gbota nan u yio
 Some part is due to the indigent Muhajirs those who were expelled from their homes and their property while seeking Grace from Allah and His Good Pleasure and aiding Allah and His Messenger such are indeed the sincere ones-,A ma kezhea la ya talakazhiy nanzhia kpela nan nanzhiy a nyan tinya ezhia zhio nan acia gan be dukiyazhiy nan Aa jin afe wa eryatwa Soko be yedan yin zaA maajin a fe jin Eko Soko be Tuciu yin taimako nan Akika za wuncinzhi ga yi za gaskiyazhio
But those who before them had homes in Medina and had adopted the Faith- show their affection to such as came to them for refuge and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to the latter but give them preference over themselves even though poverty was their own lot And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls- they are the ones that achieve prosperity,Zananzhiy ma fedun zhi nbo nan Madinao aci shiadzo naa ajin a fe wa za nanzhi gaa kpela be tsuna nan a mae de dukata ke dan yangbanazhio yan yan nanzhi a ga la yaa amaajin afe tsa yegiazhi ta eti atsozhio kaaga yi be bukata yan yan wunciny zandomdo nan ga tswiswa laadan yanbotan yan yangbanu bo nanakika zawuncinzhi ga yi za nanzhia de rabo nao
 And those who came after them say Our Lord!

Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethren among the People of the Book - If ye are expelled we too will go out with you and we will never hearken to any one in your affair and if ye are attacked in fight we will help you But Allah is witness that they are indeed liars,Wyo le za nanzhiy jin manafunci nan yea E gan be yegiazhi nanzhia jin kafirinci mini za ba Litafi zhio nan gan Wallahi a ga ye nyan tin ya yi tso ga tin ya ganni be ye yin yi maa la mi tu foro yan zandondo eti ye bo san san yina A ma ga gun ye kun ye kun yia jine taimako Akika Soko jinri ke ganmanan zuncizhi a yio nan

Of a truth ye are stronger than they because of the terror in their hearts sent by Allah This is because they are men devoid of understanding,Akika dansun ye u gbota gan dansun Soko fi yangbanazhio wuncin mayi ebo nan a de kpikpe wangia nan
They will not fight you even together except in fortified townships or from behind walls Strong is their fighting spirit amongst themselves thou wouldst think they were united but their hearts are divided that is because they are a people devoid of wisdom,A gun ye kun wo baeni boa sai de ezhi nanzhiy a ga dan gba nao ko ma zunmashin yan karazhio Nanvo atso be dozhiy u gbota Sarauyin Wyo ga lea ye Wyoa ye gan ko kpaataa nini a yio yangbanazhi ma kaka yin u yio wuncin ma yi ebo nan ade ankalia nan

O ye who believe!

 There is for you an excellent example to follow in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people We are clear of you and of whatever ye worship besides Allah we have rejected you and there has arisen between us and you enmity and hatred for ever- unless ye believe in Allah and Him alone But not when Abraham said to his father I will pray for forgiveness for thee though I have no power to get aught on thy behalf from Allah They prayed Our Lord! in Thee do we trust and to Thee do we turn in repentance to Thee is our Final Goal,Akika ye de yesan wangi dan mini Annabi Ibrahimao to jamaa nanzhi dan beuyin nan nyan kaminan a gan be jamaa yan kinmiazhi gan Akika Yi yia egwa yizhi wa be ye yin to yannan ye jin bauta ya ke Soko lugwa nan Yi maa ga jin kafirinci be ye yin ewunsun be nanvoe maa tula tsakani yi bo be ye yin har abada sai de ye ga imani jin be Sokoe gbaugi sai de egan nan Ibrahima gan be Babau yin nan akika mia ba gafara ya wye mi ma de mulki yandondo ya wye wo wba Soko boa Tsoci yan yi wyo ga yi yakpeo eba wyo ga ma yia zheban zhino ezhe keba yi ma be wyo yinu dano

 O ye who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees examine and test them Allah knows best as to their Faith if ye ascertain that they are Believers then send them not back to the Unbelievers They are not lawful wives for the Unbelievers nor are the Unbelievers lawful husbands for them But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent on their dower and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women ask for what ye have spent on their dowers and let the Unbelievers ask for what they have spent on the dowers of women who come over to you Such is the command of Allah He judges with justice between you And Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan kamina ynzagi Mumini nazhi gaa kpe la be eba ye nan e maa cin le Soko ma de kpikpe yan imania gan U ga tula ya ye gan Muminazhi ayio e ga nyana kezhe da tsun kafirizhi be ma A jin halali ya kafirizhia atso kafirizhi ma jin halali yaa yan nan kafirizhi ga wu etiabo nan ya yana la yaa Leifi ma danboa yetso ga yawo jin bea yin naa a beke ye ga sadaki laa yaa ni naa Ye mae ga lagwa suna be egban yan kafirizhiy ma e gbingan yan yannanzhi ye ga wu nan atso maa gbingan yan yannanzhi a ga wu nan Wuncin ga yi hukunci Soko nan ujin tsakani yebo nao Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio

O Prophet! When believing women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with Allah that they will not steal that they will not commit adultery or fornication that they will not kill their children that they will not utter slander intentionally forging falsehood and that they will not disobey thee in any just matter- then do thou receive their fealty and pray to Allah for the forgiveness of their sins for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Yaw ye Annabi Mumina ynzagizhi ga be eba wye acia mubayaa jin a alkwaali yan imani jin gan ala yandondo pa Soko bacia a maayi yana a maa da yancina a ma wu egizhia a maa la egi yanci be ya ebaazhia a ma le foro wangi yan wyozhi baa wyo la mubayao jin bea yin a yeda jin bea yin wyo mao ba gafara yan Soko yaa akika Soko Etsu gafara u yio Etsu yegun u yio
 O ye who believe!

Their intention is to extinguish Allah´s Light by blowing with their mouths But Allah will complete the revelation of His Light even though the Unbelievers may detest it,E wa gan a la aske Sokoa nu be misunazhiy Soko ma ga askeu she ka kafirizhi ga nanvo nan

O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples Who will be my helpers to the work of Allah Said the disciples We are Allah´s helpers! then a portion of the Children of Israel believed and a portion disbelieved But We gave power to those who believed against their enemies and they became the ones that prevailed,Ya ye nanzhia imani jin nan yea fe taimako jincizhi ya adini Soko iri kendoe Annabi Isa egi Maryama gan be Hawariyuzhiynan za nan zhi tuu zunma nan Zia jin mi taimako eti etun Soko bo Hawariyuzhi cigan Yi ga yi za nanzhia jin adini Soko taimako nao Sashi yan Banu Israilazhi cia imani jin sashi ma ajin kafirinci Yi cia za nanzhia imani jin nan ya zankpe be kagboe ta eti makiriazhio acia fe za nanzhia de nasara nan

The similitude of those who were charged with the obligations of the Mosaic Law but who subsequently failed in those obligations is that of a donkey which carries huge tomes but understands them not Evil is the similitude of people who falsify the Signs of Allah and Allah guides not people who do wrong,Kotonci yan za nanzhi yi be kpikpe yan Attaura litafi nan a cin be ya Annabi Musa nan a ma lotun be yan nanzhi litafi gan naa nan a yi ke kotonci yan tyatyagi naa karazhi la nan u de amfani ndondo boa sai wahala banza bibi be -- sunI wunajin tabbata ya za nanzhia aya Soko zhi yi ganmanan nan akika Sokoe la jamaa yan azwalumizhi ke eko gurua

 That was because there came to them messengers with Clear Signs but they said Shall mere human beings direct us So they rejected the Message and turned away But Allah can do without them and Allah is free of all needs worthy of all praise,Wuncin ma yi ebo nan Tucizhi fe jina gangba ganni be bayanizhii aci gan zawangi dozhin yi ga abe la yi ke ekoo Acia jin kafirinci acia zunma zheta bawu Soko Soko cia kunke be yandondoe akika Soko Etsu nana kunke ya ti tacinu nan uyio Etsu nan alitta kpatae jin yebo u nan uyio

O Prophet! When ye do divorce women divorce them at their prescribed periods and count accurately their prescribed periods And fear Allah your Lord and turn them not out of their houses nor shall they themselves leave except in case they are guilty of some open lewdness those are limits set by Allah and any who transgresses the limits of Allah does verily wrong his own soul thou knowest not if perchance Allah will bring about thereafter some new situation,Ya wyoe Annabi to Muminizhi kpata kaminan ye ga la yawo be yinmi yezhii nan e laa yawo lokaci nan a ga alada yan etswa jin acia lo dan lilio nan Ye mae tswa lisafi yan efo iddauzhi etswa guta Ye mae sundan Soko be tswitswa yan dokau zhi e ga nyana tinya kataabo ma atso mana ga tinya ma sai a ga da lotun yan alfahsha nana tula nan ke yancin da nan Hukunci nan nanzhi doka yan Soko dano nano zaeni ndondo na ga doka Soko gbintu nan wuna eti tacinu jin gun Hakika ye kpea ko be edun na afe nbo acia jin idda nan Soko a la egbazhe yan alhairi dan tsakani yebo be dozhi
 Thus when they fulfil their term appointed either take them back on equitable terms or part with them on equitable terms and take for witness two persons from among you endued with justice and establish the evidence as before Allah Such is the admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day And for those who fear Allah He ever prepares a way out,Lokaci nan a ga idda yan yawo la jin zo nan Yea egwa suna be boloboloe kendoe Soko ga ba hukunci nan ko ma ye gan bea yin be bolobolo kendoe Soko ga ba hukunci nan Ye mae wa za guba nanzhia gwa sun addina na ebo a jin ri yan yawo lo ko gyara yawo la Ye mae la erie kue gikini tsakanie be Sokoe Hukunci nnazhi eti yawo lao za nanzhi ga imani jin be Sokoe acia imani jin be efo zobae nan ga a jin amfani beu yin eti dansun Soko bo Zaeni ndondo na gae tswa Soko nan Sokoa jin egwagan yau ganni be eko kpe yan alhairi zhii

 Let the women live in ´iddat in the same style as ye live according to your means Annoy them not so as to restrict them And if they carry life in their wombs then spend your substance on them until they deliver their burden and if they suckle your offspring give them their recompense and take mutual counsel together according to what is just and reasonable And if ye find yourselves in difficulties let another woman suckle the child on the father´s behalf,E lugwa yinmi nanzhi ye ga ya nan afi dannan nanzhi ye tso gae fi nan har da lokaci nan iddaa a gun mi nan Ye mae ga jina gun ganni be eba yibae ma A gaa fe za nanzhi yi be ewane nan kaa wuna yi yiya gutao e fe yaa yangici gi be yandoci yan bukataazhi har da lokaci nan a ma yan nan fi ewana bo nan A ma gaa fedun eti eye la dan egi yezhio Yea laada ewo etun nan a lo nan laa yaa har da lokaci nan egi awa emi ebe o nan Ye mae fe jin bolobolo tsakanie bo be dozhi Kagan ye be lodozhi be yinmi yina eti egi kpa boa da wa yinzagi ndoci nana kpau nan

 And verily We shall recount their whole story with knowledge for We were never absent at any time or place,Gancin ma akika Yia yaa labari be kpikpe yimafe Etsu nazhia cin bo naa
The balance that day will be true to nicety those whose scale of good will be heavy will prosper,Tsunwan yan fowuncin ma uga yi gaskiyao To zandondo na tsuwanuzhi gabea lukpin na to za wuncin zhi gayi eza robo zhio Eza saa be nasara zhi
 Those whose scale will be light will be their souls in perdition for that they wrongfully treated Our signs,Zana ma tsun wan uzhi ga cin dan na zawuncin zhi ga yi zanazhiajin hasara rayia naowun cin ma yi ebo aya Yi nazhi afe jin zwalunci be yin nao
 It is We Who have placed you with authority on earth and provided you therein with means for the fulfilment of your life small are the thanks that ye give!,Akika ma Mia ye yakagbo dan kin bo Yicia eko yangici izhe wangizhi laafibo yaye Degi tsa ye ye jin yebo
 It is We Who created you and gave you shape then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam and they prostrate not so Iblis He refused to be of those who prostrate,Akika ma Yia alitta ye jin gancin Yi cia ye ya siffa gancin Yici gan be malaikazhi gan Ejin sujada ya Adama Aci da sujsda sai de ibilisu Ufe dan mini zanazhi jin sujada naboa
Allah said What prevented thee from prostrating when I commanded thee He said I am better than he Thou didst create me from fire and him from clay,Ugan Kii kan wyoe ci jin sujada yano kami na mijin wyoe foro nao Ugan Ngan mi ganu ebo na wyo jin mijin dagan enao wyo ma jinujin dagan eguno
 Allah said Get thee down from this it is not for thee to be arrogant here get out for thou art of the meanest of creatures,Ugan To acin da kin dagan miniubo ugwo yin ya wyoe na wyoa lati dan fino dan miniubo naa ebo acino acin daa kin akika wyodan mini eza gbigbacizhio
He said Give me respite till the day they are raised up,Ugan To pata ya mi har da efo naa na akin na
Allah said Be thou among those who have respite,Ugan Akika wyo dan mini zanazhi Mia pata ya naSurah  Allah said Be thou among those who have respiteUgan Akika wyo dan mini zanazhi Mia pata ya na
He said Because thou hast thrown me out of the way lo! I will lie in wait for them on thy straight way,Ugan Mi zhi kuti be hallaka na wyo jin min na akika mi ga fedun yaa ta eti ekpa wyoe natso yi gboro nao
 Then will I assault them from before them and behind them from their right and their left Nor wilt thou find in most of them gratitude for thy mercies,Gancin ma akika mia fe dzun fia dagan yegboro a bo to dagan zumazhio to dagan gwaloazhio to dagan gwapinzhio wyomaa tsun ekun dondoazhi ajin eza ye bo Sokozhia
 Allah said Get out from this disgraced and expelled If any of them follow thee- Hell will I fill with you all,Ugan Atinya dagan miniu bo eza aibu eza nyin nyi yaci Akika zandondo na ga emitu wyoe miniabo na akika miga jahannama she pin-yin dagan miniebo baenio
 O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and enjoy its good things as ye wish but approach not this tree or ye run into harm and transgression,Wyo ma Adamu! Da fedun to wyoe to nyinmi wyoe Aljannao ye mae fe gi dagan bandondo na ga bae na ye mae ga tsoba cigban na na ma kacana yegaa fe dan mini azwalumizhio
 Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them before he said Your Lord only forbade you this tree lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever,Shetan ci swo egan dede loa yangbano ebo ula sutura na fan na kanabo ci kan yavuna na-ukuu ya uci gan Ujin yandondo la Tsoci ye ci kan ye cigban nana yin gia saide ebo yebea azhe malaikazhi ma-ko ma ebo yebe fie bo be za nazhia fibo tutun yin nama
And he swore to them both that he was their sincere adviser,Uci zhi kutiya zagubaba Akika mide dan mini gangba jinci zhio ya ye
So by deceit he brought about their fall when they tasted of the tree their shame became manifest to them and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies And their Lord called unto them Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you,Uci tagwa wuaba be etae Gancin kamina abea cigban wuncin la dami na yavunazhi cia tula yaa aci da ci feda wa fini Aljannazhi kpe yavunazhi Tsocia ma ci yia zagubaba Asa Mi kan ye zagubaba gan ye kpe ya be cigban wuncin yana Mi ma gan ye gan akika shetan makiri ye uyio nayi gbangba na
 They said Our Lord! We have wronged our own souls If thou forgive us not and bestow not upon us Thy Mercy we shall certainly be lost,Za gu ba ba ci gan Tsoci yi! Yi yia eti tacin yi jin gun Kagan ma wyo jin yi gafara wyoci gun yi yea Akika yi ga fe dan mini eza hasarazhio
 Allah said Get ye down With enmity between yourselves On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood- for a time,Ugan E cin lo kin sashi ye zhi ma aga zhe makiri yan sashizhi yema yibe edun fe bae dan kinbo to ema wo yizhe da eka de gi
 He said Therein shall ye live and therein shall ye die but from it shall ye be taken out at last,Ugan Miniubo ga yea le yizheo miniubo ma yea tsu fio dagan miniubo gabo ma akuye tin yao
O ye Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame as well as to be an adornment to you But the raiment of righteousness- that is the best Such are among the Signs of Allah that they may receive admonition!Ya ye egi Adamuzhi! AkikaYicin tufuwa be ya ye na ga kpe yavun yezhi na uma yi ninpa be Tufuwa yan dasun Soko ma wyunga de alheri gano wuncin ma dan mini aya Soko zhio uijn-wo be wunciny a gaa santu,

 When they do aught that is shameful they say We found our fathers doing so and Allah commanded us thus Say Nay Allah never commands what is shameful do ye say of Allah what ye know not,Ama gada lo tun swakwa Alfasha Agan Yitsun ndayi zhi tsun ta etiu bo Soko o tso ma gajin yi foro be jin jinu yino Gangan Akika Soko ejin zando foro be etun swakwa yina kashi yea fe gangan ta Soko nyan yanna ye de kpikpe wuna na
Say My Lord hath commanded justice and that ye set your whole selves to Him at every time and place of prayer and call upon Him making your devotion sincere as in His sight such as He created you in the beginning so shall ye return,Gan gan Tsoci mi jin Yi  foro jin be gboro dae adalinci  ye mae la fuska ye nakan kpace yezhi zhie kue gikini danna salla ndondo ye mae la adinie li-e yau tsatsayin kendoe ma uca jin jin alittaye na acinga yea zheban da tsun wyuno
 Some He hath guided Others have by their choice deserved the loss of their way in that they took the evil ones in preference to Allah for their friends and protectors and think that they receive guidance,Jamaa ndocizhi danbo Soko awu ba ndoci ma danbo egbinajin tabbata ta etiabo Akika a shetanzhi la Ndakatazhi zunma yan Soko Acie le ye gan akika ezabawuzhi ayio na
 O Children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer eat and drink But waste not by excess for Allah loveth not the wasters,Yaye egi Adamuzhi! Yea ninpaezhi kuta eka to danna ya salla ndondo ye mae gi yangicizhi ye mae fin eyan finci zhi ye mae ga nyin yan ma akika Sokoe wa zanazhie nyin yan naa
Say Who hath forbidden the beautiful gifts of Allah which He hath produced for His servants and the things clean and pure which He hath provided for sustenance Say They are in the life of this world for those who believe and purely for them on the Day of Judgment Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who understandGangan ,Ngba zi ila eyan ninpa yan Soko na ula tin ya ebo anfani wuzhiuzhio na jin haramu to yangici lilicizhi dagan mini yan arzikiubo Gangan Ngan yan zanazhia imani jin na ayio dan edun fe yizhe bo uma gazhe tsitsaciyaa Efo Alkiyami Acinga ga yie kpe ayazhi yeo ya jamaa nazhi ga de kpikpe nao
Say the things that my Lord hath indeed forbidden are shameful deeds whether open or secret sins and trespasses against truth or reason assigning of partners to Allah for which He hath given no authority and saying things about Allah of which ye have no knowledge,Gangan Akika de tsoci mi yina eyan swakwazhi kpata laazhe haramu to nazhi tula miniabo na to nazhia swo na to zunubi jin to ragbanzhi nadan tsunwan gaskiya boa na ye mae ga la yandociaa pa Soko baci nama ucin hujja ndondo be etiuboa-nama ye mae gafe ganagan ta Soko na yekpe hakika wuna nama
 To every people is a term appointed when their term is reached not an hour can they cause delay nor an hour can they advance it in anticipation,Aluma ndondo ma ude ekpe ta bau ekpe taba ajali yan ndondoa maga dabe a pata yaa ka yan lokaci ninia ama laa lo ye gboroa
 O ye Children of Adam! whenever there come to you messengers from amongst you rehearsing My signs unto you- those who are righteous and mend their lives- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve,Ya ye egi Adamu zhi! Ujin wo Tuci ndoci zhi mini yetso abe ya ye acia fe ta aya zankpe Mizhi ya ye to zana ga be tswa Soko u ci jin bolobolo na to dansun ndondo adanbo ya a yangban nyin ndondo maadanbo yaa
But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance- they are companions of the Fire to dwell therein for ever,Zanazhi-maaya Yizhi yi ganmana na acia gbotika kea lugwa na zawuncinzhi ga yi egi mi na zhi bagabo ma afi tutun yino
 Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs For such their portion appointed must reach them from the Book of decrees until when our messengers of death arrive and take their souls they say Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah They will reply They have left us in the lurch And they will bear witness against themselves that they had rejected AllahT,o Ngba zii ga ti binakun a gan yan zana da tswa ganmana cia ta Soko nao ko ma ucia aya Soko Zhi yi ganmana nao Za iri na na zhi ayi be kinigi ba yin yan arziki izhe dan mini litafio har da lokaci na Tuci Yizhi ga be ebaciagwo rayi bea yin nan acia gan gan babo yannazhi ye wun zunma Soko na dano Acia gangan Aya ke yi lugwa atso ciga eri ya ta eti tacinatso ke de ayaafe kafirizhi na
 He will say Enter ye in the company of the peoples who passed away before you - men and jinns - into the Fire Every time a new people enters it curses its sister-people that went before until they follow each other all into the Fire Saith the last about the first Our Lord! it is these that misled us so give them a double penalty in the Fire He will say Doubled for all  but this ye do not understand,Ugan Eda gadan alunmanazhi gwogan shi yedzo dan mini aljanizhio to zawangizhi aci fi mini enao na Kandondo na alumma ndoci ga gandan na wyunajin ufe bukuti kpe yegiuzhi har da kamina aga ke ba be dozhi kpata na za zumazhi cia fe gan be za mafarizhi gan Tsociyi! za nanazhi ga kuyi fi egbin bo ebo acino beya be azabae yan ena naa kpeba tati dozhio na Ugan zandondo ade azaba na akpeba dozhi na Amma de ye kpea
Then the first will say to the last See then! No advantage have ye over us so taste ye of the penalty for all that ye did !,Zamafariazhi cia gan be za zumazhi gan Ngba ye de cinwan ndoci ta eti yibo ebo acino efe fin azaba ebo iri etun nazhi ye fe cewoa na
 To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance no opening will there be of the gates of heaven nor will they enter the garden until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle Such is Our reward for those in sin,Akika zanazhia aya Mi zhi yi ganmana na acia gbotika ke u lugwa na a kpe eko Aljannazhi ya aa amaade Aljanna gandana sai de har da kamina rakum ga lodan misun ekino wo na Acinga gama Yie wo lefi jincizhi gbatao
For them there is Hell as a couch below and folds and folds of covering above such is Our requital of those who do wrong,Ayi be yantaci ndoci dagan jahannamao eba titabo ma kpere nazhia fanpa fanpa yan ena na kpebo Acinga gama Yie wo azwalumizhi gbatao
 But those who believe and work righteousness- no burden do We place on any soul but that which it can bear- they will be Companions of the Garden therein to dwell for ever,Zanazhi ma imani jin na acie lotun wangizhi na Yie la kpaka a ta rayia sai yan yanna ugajin wona zawuncizhi ga yi zami Aljannazhio amaafibofi tuntunyin
And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury- beneath them will be rivers flowing- and they shall say Praise be to Allah who hath guided us to this felicity never could we have found guidance had it not been for the guidance of Allah indeed it was the truth that the messengers of our Lord brought unto us And they shall hear the cry Behold! the garden before you! Ye have been made its inheritors for your deeds of righteousness,Yicia yannazhi fi yangbaazhio yan nanvo na wa ya eduzhi cia fe je fi takoazhio acia gangan Yebo kpata ajin tabbata ya Soko na wu yiba be nana na Kagan ujin ebo na Soko a yi wuba naa da yiyi yia fe ezabawuzhia Akika Tuci Soko yizhi ada-be-yn be gaskiyae Aciyia gan Aljanna na dano daana agiu gun gi ya ye ebo iri etun wangizhi nazhi ye fe lo na
The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true Have you also found Your Lord´s promises true They shall say Yes but a crier shall proclaim between them The curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers-,Egi mi Aljannazhi cia ta mi yi egi mi nazhi gan Akika yannazhi Tsoci yi jinyi Alkawali na yia de kpata be gaskiyae ngbayannazhi tsociye jin ye Alkawali na ye tsunu acin be gaskiyae Acigan E- zanae yami na ci yami tsakaniabo ci gan Emibo yan Soko ajin tabbata ta eti azwalumizhio
Those who would hinder men from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked they were those who denied the Hereafter,Zanazhie kan zazhi eko Soko yn da na acie wagan a la wuna laazhe eko koto na amaafe zanazhi a jin kafirinci be Efo zobae na
Between them shall be a veil and on the heights will be men who would know every one by his marks they will call out to the Companions of the Garden peace on you they will not have entered but they will have an assurance thereof,Yekan ndoci ma dan tsakaniabo be dozhi eti pati yan Aarafuoma eza bagi ndoci kpebo akpe egi mi Aljanna to egi mi nazhi ye be alamaazhi Aci yi egi mi Aljannazhigan Aminci Soko ulaujin tabbata u ya ye Alaa de gandan boa amaade ejin fan fan yan gingandan
 When their eyes shall be turned towards the Companions of the Fire they will say Our Lord! send us not to the company of the wrong-doers,Ama ga eyeazhi pan daeba egi minazhi a gan Tsociyi! Ga la yi fe dan baenio be jamaa yan azwalumizhi ma
The men on the heights will call to certain men whom they will know from their marks saying Of what profit to you were your hoards and your arrogant ways,Zaba pati Aara 
Behold! are these not the men whom you swore that Allah with His Mercy would never bless Enter ye the Garden no fear shall be on you nor shall ye grieve,Ngba zananazhi ga yi fe zhi kuti etiabo ke Soka guna yea nao Aci ganagan Egandan Aljannao dansun ndondo danbo ya ye yea ye mae le yangban nyin yea
The Companions of the Fire will call to the Companions of the Garden Pour down to us water or anything that Allah doth provide for your sustenance They will say Both these things hath Allah forbidden to those who rejected Him,Egimi nazhi cia ta mi yi egi mi Aljannazhi gan E to nuwan kpeyi ko ma yandoci dagan mini arziki na Soko ya ye nao agan Akika Sokoa gubaba la jin haramu ya kafirizhi
Such as took their religion to be mere amusement and play and were deceived by the life of the world That day shall We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and as they were wont to reject Our signs,Zanazhia adinia zhi la eyan shagala be edzoe na rayuwa yan yizhe cia ta ke Soko lugwa na to Yiga atso batan kendoe atso ba efo gunguna yan yinna tan na to ayayi nazhi afe gbomi be yin na
 For We had certainly sent unto them a Book based on knowledge which We explained in detail- a guide and a mercy to all who believe,Akika ma yi be yabe litafi Yicia egan zhi kpe ye fibo eti kpikpeo ebo ulaufe bawu be yeguny ya jamaa nazhie ya Soko gaskiya na
Do they just wait for the final fulfilment of the event On the day the event is finally fulfilled those who disregarded it before will say The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true tidings Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf Or could we be sent back then should we behave differently from our behaviour in the past In fact they will have lost their souls and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch,Kashi e ka yandoci ka naayi bayani yan gbangba eti alkiyamio na fondondo na bayani yan gbangba ga be yaa na zanazhiu batan shidzo batsozhio na agangan Akika Tuci yan Tsoci yizhi be be gaskiyae To ngba yide egwatancizhi nazhia tangwa ya yi na koma a la yiyia laada yizhe ebo yi dae lo tun wangizhi ndoci yan nazhi yife lo shibo le na Akika ajin hasara rayiazhi gamana nazhi ma afe tswa na agbinayeo
 Your Guardian-Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the throne of authority He draweth the night as a veil o´er the day each seeking the other in rapid succession He created the sun the moon and the stars all governed by laws under His command Is it not His to create and to govern Blessed be Allah the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!,Akika Tsoci ye uga yi Soko Etsu najin alitta samazhi to kin dan mini efo gutsunayin o na gancin ucia jin dai dai ta eti Alarashio wyune la yeshi laakpe batin ucia fe din ye fe wau va vayin to yigidi to etswa to tswangizhi kpata wyunga daa ku be forouyin ya alittazhio Akika wyunga wun alittazhi to alamariazhio Albarka yan Sokoa latu Etsu nae kpa alittazhi kpata na
Call on your Lord with humility and in private for Allah loveth not those who trespass beyond boundsEfe yi Tsocie ye be ejpedae to swiswoci Akika wyunewa za nazhi gae gwo iyaka gan naa,
 Do no mischief on the earth after it hath been set in order but call on Him with fear and longing in your hearts for the Mercy of Allah is always near to those who do good,Ye mae ga nyin yan fi kinbo ba ci yan edzutau bo ma Ye mae fe yi uUye ebo dasuno to evunbae Akika yegun Soko utsoba zanazhie jin bolobolona kpanyin
 It is He Who sendeth the winds like heralds of glad tidings going before His mercy when they have carried the heavy-laden clouds We drive them to a land that is dead make rain to descend thereon and produce every kind of harvest therewith thus shall We raise up the dead perchance ye may remember,Wyun ga mae tun efe zhi tuno ebo ula labari yangbanfa yan yegun Soko nadan yegboro nau yaye harda kamina uga girgije zhi la ucia lukpin na Yici gau dagwa da ezhi nayi tsutsuci naYicia du le zhin beuyin yicia la yangici sunsunzhi iri ndondo tinya beuyin Aciga ga Yie la eyan tsutsucizhi tin yao ujinwo be wunciny yega santu
From the land that is clean and good by the will of its Cherisher springs up produce rich after its kind but from the land that is bad springs up nothing but that which is niggardly thus do we explain the signs by various symbols to those who are grateful,Ezhi na ma yi wangi na yangici sunsunuzhi ga tinya be izini Tsociuyin ezhi nama gaa nyin-na Yangici sunsunu wunatinyaa sai be wahalae Acinga ga Yie kpe ayazhi ye ya jamaa nazhi gae jin yebo Soko nao

Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord through a man of your own people to warn you call in remembrance that He made you inheritors after the people of Noah and gave you a stature tall among the nations Call in remembrance the benefits ye have received from Allah that so ye may prosper,Kashi ye jin mamaki jin na sinsantu be ya ye gwata eza bagi ndoci mini yebo ebo udebaujin ye gangba nao Ye mae fe pa kamina Soko la ye zhe halifa zunma yan jamaa yan Nuhuzhio na uci beye cinwan nakan kpace dan alittao Ebo acino efe pa nima Soko zhi ujinwo be wunciny ye ga de nasara

And remember how He made you inheritors after the ´Ad people and gave you habitations in the land ye build for yourselves palaces and castles in open plains and care out homes in the mountains so bring to remembrance the benefits ye have received from Allah and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth,Ye mae pa kamina Soko la yezhe egwagwoci yan kinzhi zunma Aduzhio na ucia ye ya edunfeba wangi kin bo ye cie tu emikozhi dagan danna didaciuzhio ye mae sa katazhi dagan patiuzhio ebo acino efe pa nima Soko zhi yemae ga za kpe kinbo yeafe eyan nyincizhi ma
The leaders of the arrogant party among his people said to those who were reckoned powerless - those among them who believed know ye indeed that Salih is a messenger from his Lord They said We do indeed believe in the revelation which hath been sent through him,Wancin nazhia gbotika dan mini jamaa yanuzhio na cia gan be zanazhi yi zagbogunzhi na nazhi ma imani jin miniabo na Ngba ko ye kpewo gan Salihu Tuci uyio dagan eba Tsociubo Agan yi de akika yia imani jin be etun naatununa
 The Arrogant party said For our part we reject what ye believe in,Zanazhia gbotikana cigan Akika yi ma yia jin kafirinci be yan na ye jin imani be yin nae
Then they ham-strung the she-camel and insolently defied the order of their Lord saying O Salih! bring about thy threats if thou art a messenger of Allah!,Acia rakun tunyan acia gbotika be foro Tsocia yin acigan Ya Salihu! Beya ya yi be alkawali azaba na wyoe jin yi na wunayi gan mini Tuci Soko zhi bo wyo danona
So the earthquake took them unawares and they lay prostrate in their homes in the morning,!Kabara be dudu yan kin cia wan acia tinba fi emiazhio agbin ya zhi zhi be fuskazhi kpe kinbo

For ye practise your lusts on men in preference to women  ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds,Akika ye yelo ba bagi naycin yezhi eti shahawao ke yinzagizhi lugwa Aa yede eyan nyin cizhi ye yio
And his people gave no answer but this they said Drive them out of your city these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!,Yandondo mafedan jawabi yan jamaa yanuzhi boa sai de egan naagan gan ye a ku tinya dagan alkarya ebo Akika a ezazhiayio nazhie wa lili be edzutae na
 But we saved him and his family except his wife she was of those who legged behind,Yiciu wadzun to jamaa yanuzhi sai de yinmiu naafedan mini za nazhi badan zunmao na

And squat not on every road breathing threats hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him and seeking in it something crooked But remember how ye were little and He gave you increase And hold in your mind´s eye what was the end of those who did mischief,Ye mae ga fe da fedun ta ekondondo fe yiba ba zazhi fe kan eko Soko yinda ya zanazhia imani jin na ma fe wa gan eko Soko ulauzhe kandan ye mae pa kamina ye yi eza de gi Soko cia ye laadokunna Ye mae cinele-elo kendoe zoba yan zanazhie nyin yan na yi yi na
And if there is a party among you who believes in the message with which I have been sent and a party which does not believe hold yourselves in patience until Allah doth decide between us for He is the best to decide,Uma gabea fe gan kasan ndoci mini yebo a imani jin be yanna atun mi tun na kasan ndoci ma alaa yegan ajin imania to yea hakuri jin har Soko ula hukunciu ba tsakani yibo beayin Soko gama gan zanazhie jin hukunci kpata nao
The leaders the arrogant party among his people said O Shu´aib! we shall certainly drive thee out of our city - thee and those who believe with thee or else ye thou and they shall have to return to our ways and religion He said What! even though we do detest them,Wancin nazhia gbotika mini jamaa yanuhio na gan Akika yi gao yan dzuntinya wyoe Shuaibu to zanazhia imani jin ganin beoyin na dagan alkarya yibo Koma baenio ye-daezhin adini yi Ugan Ngba! Ka wunayi gan yi ya navo
We should indeed invent a lie against Allah if we returned to your ways after Allah hath rescued us therefrom nor could we by any manner of means return thereto unless it be as in the will and plan of Allah Our Lord Our Lord can reach out to the utmost recesses of things by His knowledge In the Allah is our trust our Lord! decide Thou between us and our people in truth for Thou art the best to decide,Akikama yi ga ganmana tswa ta Soko dano na yi gake zhe dazhi adini ye na ba ci na Sokoa yi wadzun tinya dagan miniubo na uma ga gwoyin na yia kezhe dazhin bo be naa sai de yanna gabe ba Soko Tsoci yi cijin be yi yin na Tsoci yi wyuna yandondo makezhe be kpikpe Soko gama yi yakpeo Tsoci yi!

The leaders the unbelievers among his people said If ye follow Shu´aib be sure then ye are ruined!,Wancin nazhia jin kafirci mini jamaa yanuzhio na cigan ye ma ga mitu Shuaybu akika ma ye ga zhe eza hasarazhi
But the earthquake took them unawares and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning!,Kunkun yan samma cia wan gancin acia tinba fi emiazhio a nikin zhi zhi be fuska zhikpe kinbo
The men who reject Shu´aib became as if they had never been in the homes where they had flourished the men who rejected Shu´aib - it was they who were ruined!,Zanazhi yi egan Shuaibu ganmana na afe ke wyoa yegan ko afe fi yizhe boa nazanazhi yi egan Shuaibu ganmana na afe agayi eza hasarazhio
So Shu´aib left them saying O my people! I did indeed convey to you the messages for which I was sent by my Lord I gave you good counsel but how shall I lament over a people who refuse to believe!,Ucia zunma ce kea lugwa uci gan ya ye jamaa yan mizhi! Hakika mia yan wu ya ye yan etun na Tsoci mi tun mi na Mi ma jin ye gangba to ke adada mi cia fe nyin yangban eti azaba jamaa nazhia jin kafirinci nao
Whenever We sent a prophet to a town We took up its people in suffering and adversity in order that they might learn humility,Yima laatun Annabi ndoci lo alkarya ndoci lea sai de yi ga za kin wun cin nazhia lebana wan be azabae be bayibazhi to be egunzhi ujinwo be wunciny afe da kpya ya Soko
Then We changed their suffering into prosperity until they grew and multiplied and began to say Our fathers too were touched by suffering and affluence  Behold! We called them to account of a sudden while they realised not their peril,Gancin Yicie la gwasan laadan eyandedeo be eyan wangi har ala-dokun acia gangan Hakika egun be azabae a yanmanci yizhi togwa aci kezhe da kafirinciyn jin zhi be Gancin Yicia wan kpake te yin uma yi be kakpea yina
If the people of the towns had but believed and feared Allah We should indeed have opened out to them All kinds of blessings from heaven and earth but they rejected the truth and We brought them to book for their misdeeds,Hakika ma da acigan jamaa yan alkaryazhi ga imani jin jin aci tswa Soko be dan sunu yin dayi ga eko albarkazhi kpe yaa dagan samao to kinbo ammaade a alamari Soko yi ganmana ebo acino Yicia wan be iri etun nazhi afe cewou na
Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of Our wrath by night while they were asleep,Kashi jamaa yan alkaryazhi a aminci ya ya gan azaba ucinube uta a be yeshi alali ma a dan mini ele leo
 Or else did they feel secure against its coming in broad daylight while they played about care-free,Kashi jamaa yan alkaryazhi a aminci ya ya ke azaba Yi ubeu yaa lokaci yan batiny kamina adan mini edzo na
Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allah- but no one can feel secure from the Plan of Allah except those doomed to ruin!,Kashi a aminci ya ya be tangitso yan Sokoe To ade zandondo naaya aminci be tangi tso Sokoe naa sai de jamaa nazhi ga yi eza hasarazhi na
To those who inherit the earth in succession to its previous possessors is it not a guiding lesson that if We so willed We could punish them too for their sins and seal up their hearts so that they could not hear,Kashiukun bawu ya zanazhe gigun yan kin baci yan jamaa nazhi ga -- gan naa ke wuna ba yi ba Yigaa wan be zunubiazhi-naa Yici ga eyan latea yangbanzhio aci gaafe zanazhie wogana naayana
Such were the towns whose story We thus relate unto thee There came indeed to them their messengers with clear signs But they would not believe what they had rejected before Thus doth Allah seal up the hearts of those who reject faith,Alkarya wuncinzhi Yie ta ya wyoe dagan mini labariazhio hakika ma Tuciazhi be yaa be hujja nazhi tula na to amafe zanazhia jin imani be yanan uuyi ganmana shidzo batsozhio naa Acinga ga Sokoe la eyan te yangban yan kafirizhio
 Most of them We found not men true to their covenant but most of them We found rebellious and disobedient,Yi ma tsun alkawali kpoki be ekun dondo azhi yina akika Yitsun ekundondoazhi fasikizhi ayio
Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs but they wrongfully rejected them So see what was the end of those who made mischief,Gancin be Yi ci tun Musa tun zummaabo be hujja Yizhi lo eba firauna be nunsa-jamaa yanuzhi acia eti tacina jin zwalunci beuyin to cinle kendoe zoba zanazhie nyin yan na yi yi nae
Moses said O Pharaoh! I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds-,Musa ci gan ya wyoe firauna! Hakika mi Tuci mi yio dagan eba Etsu naekpa alittazhi kpata nae
 One for whom it is right to say nothing but truth about Allah Now have I come unto you people from your Lord with a clear Sign So let the Children of Israel depart along with me,Hakika uyio ke de mia gan gan ndondo eti Soko boa sai de na ga yi gaskiya na akika mi be ya ye be bayani naatula na dagan eba Tsoci yebo ebo acino a Banu Israela zhi ya ya mi
Pharaoh said If indeed thou hast come with a Sign show it forth- if thou tellest the truth,Ugan wunayi gan wyo be be hujja naatula na to laube yn wyo gaafe dan mini eza gaskiya zhio na
Then Moses threw his rod and behold! it was a serpent plain for all to see!,Ucia tsun kunu ce ci ci ucia zhe wanko naatula na
And he drew out his hand and behold! it was white to all beholders!,Uci kezhea egwau wa tinya ucia zhe bokun be haske ya zanazhie cin ba le na
Said the Chiefs of the people of Pharaoh This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed,Wancin yan majalisa Firauna zhi cigan Hakika za na na eyan manci uyio kpikpe de ci uyio
His plan is to get you out of your land then what is it ye counsel,Wyune wa wa gan ula ye yeu lautinya dagan kinmiebo to gbani ki yi shawara ye yeo
They said Keep him and his brother in suspense for a while and send to the cities men to collect-,Aci gan Uu dan kangi bedzo to yegiu wyo mao tun za zhio lo ezhinin ebo jamaazhia laaguna yekan
 And bring up to thee all our sorcerers well-versed,Amaa bea ya wyoe be eyan manci ndondoe na de kpi kpe na
 So there came the sorcerers to Pharaoh They said of course we shall have a suitable reward if we win!,Eyan mancizhi ma da be eba firauna aci gan ngba hakika yi gaade galaba yiade ega gba yan etun
He said Yea and more- for ye shall in that case be raised to posts nearest to my person,Ugan Acin gao hakikama yega fedan mini eza tsonba zhio
They said O Moses! wilt thou throw first or shall we have the first throw,Acigan wyoe Musa! Ko de wyo lau kaynce koma yi-lay fe zanazhia ce na
 Said Moses Throw ye first So when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them for they showed a great feat of magic,Ugan ye fe ce To kamina a ce yanzhi na aeye zazhi jin sihiri acia li dansun aci be be sihiri na wancin nae
We put it into Moses´s mind by inspiration Throw now thy rodand behold! it swallows up straight away all the falsehoods which they fake!,Yici jin wahayi fi Musa gan Atsukun wyo ce ci ci gancin uci fe ku yanazhi a man yan ganmana na nyin
Thus truth was confirmed and all that they did was made of no effect,Gaskiy cia tula etun nazhi ama fe lo na cia nyin ya
So the great ones were vanquished there and then and were made to look small,Acia zankpe ba gao acia zheban afe eza gbi gba ci zhi
 But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration,Eyan manci zhi cia nikin zhi-zhi eti ekpyadao
Saying We believe in the Lord of the Worlds-,Aci gan yi yia imani jin be Etsu naekpa halittazhi kpata na
The Lord of Moses and Aaron,Tsoci yan Musa to Harunae
Said Pharaoh Believe ye in Him before I give you permission Surely this is a trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out its people but soon shall ye know the consequences,Firauna ci gan Asa ye yea imani jin beu yin tun mi laya ye izinia Hakika na na makirinci uyio na ye jin fi zhininbo na ebo yela zazhi zhie nyane tine ya dagan minubo to be le yin ma yeabe kpe yan na miajin na
Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on apposite sides and I will cause you all to die on the cross,Hakika ma migae egwazhi ba ya to biciezhi eti cice le bao bici gwalo be egwa gwapiny gancin mici gae fo-sa baenio
They said For us We are but sent back unto our Lord,Agan Hakika yi de eba Tsoci yi tsa yia zheban lo
But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the Signs of our Lord when they reached us! Our Lord! pour out on us patience and constancy and take our souls unto thee as Muslims who bow to thy will!,Dalili ndondo ma danbo na wyo ga jin yi azaba naa sai de ebo na yia imani jin be egwa-wu yan zankpe Tsoci yi nae kamina ube ya yi na! ya wyoe Tsociyi! To nuwan hankuri kpeyi wyo mao wu yi musulumizhi
 Said the chiefs of Pharaoh´s people Wilt thou leave Moses and his people to spread mischief in the land and to abandon thee and thy gods He said Their male children will we slay only their females will we save alive and we have over them power irresistible,Wancin yan majalisazhi dagan mini jamaa yan firauna ci gan Ye ga Musa ya to jamaa yanuzhi ebo afea nyin-yanafi kinbo uciu la wyoyou ya be kuti wyo yin Ugan yi ga egi bagiazhi wu yi ci ga yinzagiazhi lugwa hakika yima eza zankpe zhi yi yi ta etiabo
Said Moses to his people Pray for help from Allah and wait in patience and constancy for the earth is Allah´s to give as a heritage to such of His servants as He pleaseth and the end is best for the righteous,Musa cia gan ya jamaa yanuzhi gan E wa taimako be Sokoe ye mae la hankurie jin hakika kin na na Soko wuno wyune lau gi gun ya zana ga bau mini wuzhiu zhiona zoba wangima wunajin tabbata ya zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundanu na
 They said We have had nothing but trouble both before and after thou camest to us He said It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth that so He may try you by your deeds,Acigan Ajin yi gun kafi wyo beo ya yi na to baci na wyo be ya yi na Ugan kengiI uyio na aga makiriyezhi jin hallaka na uci ga ye ya kagbo kpe eti kinbo gancin ucia fe cin ye le kendoe ye ga jin jin na
We punished the people of Pharaoh with years of droughts and shortness of crops that they might receive admonition,Hakika ma Yia firauna wan be edagi-I yan eya nadokun na be kike yan yangici latizhi wataki-la be wunciny agasantu
 But when good times came they said This is due to us When gripped by calamity they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah´s sight but most of them do not understand!,Gancin ma alheri ndoci gaa deaagan Nana yan yi uyio Eyan de de maga tswana agan Musa tsa jina efuo to wyin to zanazhi pama beu yin na! To hakika egagba yan efu de de azhi danbe Sokoe amaade ekun dondo azhi akpea
They said to Moses Whatever be the Signs thou bringest to work therewith thy sorcery on us we shall never believe in thee,Aci gan yandondo na wyo ga be beyin ya yi yan egwa wu zankpe aya na ebo wyo lao jin yi sihiri eyan ma na To yi ga to bo wyo bo yia imani jina
 So We sent plagues on them Wholesale death Locusts Lice Frogs And Blood Signs openly self-explained but they were steeped in arrogance- a people given to sin,Yici tun azaba yan tufanu na fewua na fia to eyan fufungizhi to kwokwota to tankpolo zhi to egya ayazhi na zhi yi kaka yin-na acia gbotika acia fe jama nazhi yi le fi jin ci zhi na
Every time the penalty fell on them they said O Moses! on your behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee If thou wilt remove the penalty from us we shall truly believe in thee and we shall send away the Children of Israel with thee,Kamina masiba bea cin taa na aci ganYa Musa! Ba aduwa ya yi be tsoci wyo yin ebo alkawali na wyo de beu yin na hakika wyo ga azaba la keyabo ya yi hakika yi ga azaba la keyabo ya yi Bani Israila zhi ya ya wyoe
 But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfil- Behold! they broke their word!,To kamina yi bea masiba wuncin la keyabo yayan lokaci degi na kanga gancin acia fe zanazhie lo al kawa li ya na
So We exacted retribution from them We drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them,Yici jin azaba yan egagba yicia gbin fi mini eduo ebo na hakika a aya Yizhi yi ganmana Acia fe zanazhia ya-ye keu lugwa na
 And We made a people considered weak and of no account inheritors of lands in both east and west - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they had patience and constancy and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected with such pride,Yicia Banu israila zhi laazhe edu tu aci da gun be jamaa ndoci nazhia gi ba wun wun yan ku ti azhi na aci gan Ya wyoe Musa! A yan doci ci ci ya yi na yia fe wun nae Ugan hakika ye jamaa tsoye yeo nazhi kpe yan dondo yea na
 We took the Children of Israel with safety across the sea They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had They said O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have He said Surely ye are a people without knowledge,Yicia Banu Israila zhi laazhe edu tu aci da gun be jamaa ndoci nazhia gi ba wun wun yan ku ti azhi na aci gan Ya wyoe Musa! A yan ndoci ci ci ya yi na yia fe wun nae Ugan hakika ye jamaa tsaye yeo nazhi kpe yan dondo yea na
 As to these folk- the cult they are in is but a fragment of a ruin and vain is the worship which they practise,Hakika za nanazhi yanna adan-y ninbo na yannaa jina hallaka na uyio yan na mae jin kpata na ganmana uyio
He said Shall I seek for you a god other than the true Allah when it is Allah Who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations,Ugan Ngba ndoci zumaci Soko ga mia la ya ye Tsocio alali ma Soko ga ya ye daraja ta eti alitta zhi bo
And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh´s people who afflicted you with the worst of penalties who slew your male children and saved alive your females in that was a momentous trial from your Lord,Ye mae fe pa  lokaci na yi ganyegwa dagan egwa jamaa yan firauna zhio na afe jin ye azaba de de Afe wu egi bagi yezhi acie la yinzagi ye zhi lugwa mini wuncino mimancin le wanciko danbo dagan eba Tsoci ye bo
 We appointed for Moses thirty nights and completed the period with ten more thus was completed the term of communion with his Lord forty nights And Moses had charged his brother Aaron before he went up Act for me amongst my people Do right and follow not the way of those who do mischief,Yima jin Musa alkawali nya yeshi gbanwo Yi cia gunmi be efo guwoe gancin lokaci yan Tsociu beuyin cia gunmi dan yeshi shibao Musa cia gan be yegiu yin Harunae gan Gikini yami dan mini jamaa yan mizhio wyo mao jin gyara tsakaniabo wyo mao ga la mitu ekpa yan zanazhie nyin yan nama
When Moses came to the place appointed by Us and his Lord addressed him He said O my Lord! show Thyself to me that I may look upon thee Allah said By no means canst thou see Me direct But look upon the mount if it abide in its place then shalt thou see Me When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount He made it as dust And Moses fell down in a swoon When he recovered his senses he said Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance and I am the first to believe,Kamina Musa be mikati yi na Tsociu cigan be uyin Musa cigan ya wyoe Tsoci mi!

And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters both commanding and explaining all things and said Take and hold these with firmness and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked- How they lie desolate,Yima cia ka yau dan mini elozhio egan iri ndondo ulau fe waazi be egan ye kpe ya yandondo Eboacino agwa suna be kagboe wyo mao jin jamaa yan wyozhi foro ala gwasun bolo bolouzhi bele-yin mia la emi yan fasikizhi wu yehttps//playgooglecom/store/apps/detailsid=comnoorlabalquran
Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My signs Even if they see all the signs they will not believe in them and if they see the way of right conduct they will not adopt it as the way but if they see the way of error that is the way they will adopt For they have rejected our signs and failed to take warning from them,Mi ga za nazhie gbotika ta eti kinbo umayi be haki ndondo yinana pan ya ke aya Mi zhi lugwa Ama ga le aya ndondo ye ajin imani beu yina ama ga eko bawu leye alau eko kirikia ama ga eko egbin leyeagau la eko kiriki Wuncin mayi ebona aya Yi zhi yi ganmana na acia fe za nazhia ya ye keu lugwa na

 The people of Moses made in his absence out of their ornaments the image of calf for worship it seemed to low did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor show them the way They took it for worship and they did wrong,Jamaa yan Musa zhi cia nanko la dagan mini eyan ninpaazhio aciu sa nakan kpace naetiwu dozhin nanko na Ngba aleyea kede akika wyune gan gan bea yina na a umae laa ke eko gboroa naa Acia egwa sunu ama cia fe azwalumizhi
When they repented and saw that they had erred they said If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us we shall indeed be of those who perish,Kamina abea ya rogbonkpe-yn-tina atso cia le ye gbangbae ke de hakika a yagbin na agan hakika kagan Tsoci yi gun yi ye uci kezhe fa be yiyina yi gaafe dan mini eza hasarazhio
When Moses came back to his people angry and grieved he said Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord He put down the tablets seized his brother by the hair of his head and dragged him to him Aaron said Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune nor count thou me amongst the people of sin,Kamina ma Musa dazhin eba jamaa yanuzhi na wyunafe zanaa zhewun uma nyin yangban na Ucigan Alawa be iri kendoe yegikinigi yami zunma mi bo na!

 Those who took the calf for worship will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord and with shame in this life thus do We recompense those who invent falsehoods,Akika za nazhi da la nanko gigi Tsoci ci fe wun na ewunzhe yan tsocia gaajin tabatta ta etiabo ganni be egbae mini edun fe izheo acinga ga ma yie ga zanazhie tswa ganmana nagbao

And ordain for us that which is good in this life and in the Hereafter for we have turned unto Thee He said With My punishment I visit whom I will but My mercy extendeth to all things That mercy I shall ordain for those who do right and practise regular charity and those who believe in Our signs,Wyo mao ka bolobolooya yi dan mini yizhe nanao to mini efo zobae alkiyamio Hakika yi yia tuba jin be eba wyoe Ugan Azaba Mi Mie lau la jin zana gaba Mi na yegun yan Mi ma wyuna gwo yandondo Mi ma gau laajin tabatta ya zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundanuna amae la zakka dukiyazhi wa na to zanazhia imani jin be aya yi zhii na
Those who follow the messenger the unlettered Prophet whom they find mentioned in their own scriptures- in the law and the Gospel- for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil he allows them as lawful what is good and pure and prohibits them from what is bad and impure He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them So it is those who believe in him honour him help him and follow the light which is sent down with him- it is they who will prosper,Za nazhie la mi tu Tuci na nayi Annbi na nayi umiyyu na zana gba katun lea uma ka leana nama atso tsunu kikaci ebaabo fi mini Attaurao to Injilao na wyune jina foro be etun wangizhi umae kana etun dedeynlo umae la eyan wangizhi jin halali yaa umae la eyan dedezhi jin haramu yaa umae la eyan kpinluzhi ke yabo yaa to kuruzhi nazhi ta eti abo yan dandanzhi na To zanazhi ga imani jin beu yin na aci gbouka na aci jinu taimako na acia mi tu haske naacin be yau na zawuncinzhi ga yi eza robozhio

 We divided them into twelve tribes or nations We directed Moses by inspiration when his thirsty people asked him for water Strike the rock with thy staff out of it there gushed forth twelve springs Each group knew its own place for water We gave them the shade of clouds and sent down to them manna and quails saying Eat of the good things We have provided for you but they rebelled to Us they did no harm but they harmed their own souls,Yicia sa fi sibti ezhimi ko kin guwo be gubae alunmazhi Yici jin wahayi ya Musa kamina jamaa yanuzhi wa nuwan finfinci beu yin na gan A tsukun wyoe la zhe kin eye nuwanzhi har guwo be gubae cia la tinya dagan miniubo hakika zaeni ndondo kpe nuwan finbau ye  Yicia wuru yan girgije laakpea Yici cin manna nuwan managi ke efuna to nakan lukukuzhi yaa egi dagan mana mana yan arziki na Yi la ya ye na Ama jin yi zwaluncia amaa de eti tacina tsa ejin zwaluncio

 Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them openly holding up their heads but on the day they had no Sabbath they came not thus did We make a trial of them for they were given to transgression,Wyo mao gbinagan labari alkarya wuncin na ci kpata misunona kamina afe -- iyaka gan eti hukunci efo Asibio na Sokoa ikan wan laazhe haramu yaa asibi foe kanga ma ikanazhi ciaajin afe tin ya gu ra rae Efo na majin Asibi yaa na ikan zhi etin ya ya a Acinga ga Yi fe manacileo ebo fasikanci nazhi afejin nao
When some of them said Why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment- said the preachers To discharge our duty to your Lord and perchance they may fear Him,To kamina jamaa ndocizhi miniabo gan Ebo kiibo ye cie jin jamaa nazhi Soko ajin hallaka na ko ma wyuna jin a azaba tsuntsunnu na waazio Acigan yie jin jin ebo ulau fe uzuri-u ya yi lo eba tsoci ye uma jinwo be wunciny agaa fe za nazhie sundan sokona
When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them We rescued those who forbade Evil but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression,Kamina abea tanba laalo yan nazhi asanatu be yin na Yia za na zhie na-wun cie kan etun dede na gangwa Yicia zanazhia eti taacinazhi jin zwalunci na wan be azaba bibiciy ebo etun fasikanci nazhi afe lo na
When in their insolence they transgressed all prohibitions We said to them Be ye apes despised and rejected,Gancin kamina abea gbotika ke yan na akana na lugwa na Yici ganagan ye tsoa zhe ebegizhi nazhi yi eyan gbi gba ci zhi na
Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them to the Day of Judgment those who would afflict them with grievous penalty Thy Lord is quick in retribution but He is also Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,To kamina Tsoci wyoe yami na akika wyuna tun zadedezhi fia har da efo Alkiyami nazhia fe ya azaba dedezhi fin na hakika Tsoci wyoe Etsu nae din ye be jin jin azabae na uyio hakika ma wyiny Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
 We broke them up into sections on this earth There are among them some that are the righteous and some that are the opposite We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity In order that they might turn to us,Yicia sa fi kinbo aciafe jamaa kpere kperezhi miniabo ade zaguruzhi fibo mini abo ma ade nazhi jin za guru zhia na Yima maacinle be eyan wangi zhi to be eyan dedezhi ko be wuncin-y a zheban eti ekpya dao lo eba Soko
After them succeeded an evil generation They inherited the Book but they chose for themselves the vanities of this world saying for excuse Everything will be forgiven us Even so if similar vanities came their way they would again seize them Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth and they study what is in the Book But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter Will ye not understand,Gancin za zun mazhi ci be gwo gwa zunma yan zanazhia shi dzo nao acia litafi gigun kpikpeu acie da gwo eyan zwizwoci yan izhe gbi gba ci na na kini giba yan bawu Soko acie gan gan bele yin afa be yi yin Eyan zwi zwoci ci izhe yan haramu ndoci ga be yaa be a tagwa gwo yana Asa a la alkawali yan litafi bea yin ke de aga gan gan ndondo eti alamari Sokoo maa sai de na ga yi gaskiya naa Alali ma atso ayan nazhi fi li ta fio na gba hakika ma Emi yan zoba batsozhi ude alheri gan izhe na na ya za na zhi gae tswa Soko acie sundanuna Ngba kashi ye de ankali dea
 As to those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer- never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish,Zanazhi mae la gwa sun litafi na aci kezhea sallah ku gikini na hakika Yi yie ta ega gba yan zaguruzhi ya kpea
 When We shook the Mount over them as if it had been a canopy and they thought it was going to fall on them We said Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring ever to remembrance what is therein perchance ye may fear Allah,To kamina Yi la pati tu ta etiabo na wyo cia ye gan ko girgije uyio aci fe kpaye ke de hakika ugaa kpankpea na aci gan agan yea egwa sun yan na Yi la ya ye na be kagboe ye mae fepa yan na zhi fi bo na ujin wo be wunciny ye ga fe za na zhie tswa Soko acie sun danuna
When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify concerning themselves saying Am I not your Lord who cherishes and sustains you- They said Yea! We do testify! This lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment Of this we were never mindful,Wyo mao pa lokaci na Tsoci wyoe la alkawali be egi yan Adama zhi-na dagan mini dzo dzoa zhio zuriyaazhi dan bo ucia atso laafe eri jincizhi ta eti tacinatso zhio uci gan Asa ujin Migayi Tsoci ye yea Acigan Eba acinga gao yima eri jin aci gan Ebo Efo Alkiyamio ye be gan gan Akika yi yia ya ye ke alkawali na na lugwa ma
Or lest ye should say Our fathers before us may have taken false gods but we are their descendants after them wilt Thou then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were futile,Ko ma ye be gan gan Akika de yanmanci yi zhi tsa la yan pa Soko baci caba batso zhibo yi maafe zuriyaazhi zunmaabo Kashi Ngba wyo ga yi jin hallaka ebo le fi nazhi eza egbin zhi gan ma na zuncizhi jin nae
Thus do We explain the signs in detail and perchance they may turn unto Us,Acinga ga ma Yi yia jin yi kpe aya zhi yeo be bayani zhi yino ujinwo be wunciny zawangizhia zheban da tsun Soko be ekpyadae
 Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs but he passed them by so Satan followed him up and he went astray,Wyo mao gba labario yaa yan za na yi la aya Yi zhi be ya na ucia miniu wa ya dagan minia bo na gan cin shetan ci fe gbauza ucia fe dan mini zanazhia jin hallaka nao
If it had been Our will We should have elevated him with Our signs but he inclined to the earth and followed his own vain desires His similitude is that of a dog if you attack him he lolls out his tongue or if you leave him alone he still lolls out his tongue That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs So relate the story perchance they may reflect,Uma ga ba Yi ba da Yi gau laatu be aya wuncin zhi amma de wyun tso egba wa dan kin bo ucia emi tu etun yan gbanu koton ci yan za wuncin wunafe ke koton ci eshigi na wyo ga wau wun ufe ce gin tara ka wyo ma gau ya yanu wunafe ce gintara na na ga yi koton ci yan jamaa nazhia aya Soko zhi yi gan ma nao gba etan labari na na yaa ujin wo be wunciny aga fe za na zhiekpa ye na
Evil as an example are people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls,Bibi wunajin tabatta ya koton ci yan jamaa nazhia aya Yizhi yi ganmana na eti tacinatso tsa ma ejin zwaluncioSurah Whom Allah doth guide- he is on the right path whom He rejects from His guidance- such are the persons who perishZandondo na Soko gaa la ke eko na wyun ga ke eko za na ma ugau gbin na To zawun cin zhi ga yi eza hassara zhio
 Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell They have hearts wherewith they understand not eyes wherewith they see not and ears wherewith they hear not They are like cattle- nay more misguided for they are heedless of warning,Hakika ma yi jin alittazhi ebo jahannamao nazhi dokun na mini aljanizhio to zawan gi zhio ayi be yan gban zhi egan zhi mae yea ama yi be eye zhiamae laa le ba yea ama yi be tukpa zhi amae laa wo gana zawuncin zhi ke dabba zhi na ayio Eba hakika ake ke gbu gbu gan dabbazhi eba egbino zawun cinzhi ga yi eye ya ci zhio
The most beautiful names belong to Allah so call on him by them but shun such men as use profanity in his names for what they do they will soon be requited,Soko ma yi be sunna wan gi zhi ebo acino efebau yan be a yin ye mae dzun gan zana zhie nyin sunna Soko zhi ya nao Be le yin agaagba be iri etun nazhie lo na
 Of those We have created are people who direct others with truth And dispense justice therewith,A ma de dan mini alitta nazhi Yi jin na jamaazhi ayio e-wu zazhi ba be gaskiyae be uyin ma gae jin adalincio
 Those who reject Our signs We shall gradually visit with punishment in ways they perceive not,Zanazhi ma aya Yi zhi yi gan mana na Yia dzua lo edzun ba ndoci yi cia dzun fia dagan ba na ade kpi kpe wuna na
Respite will I grant unto them for My scheme is strong and unfailing,Mimae pata pa yaa hakika tangi tso yan Mi ugbo ka sarau yin 
 Do they not reflect Their companion is not seized with madness he is but a perspicuous warner,Kashi akpa ye kpaa ngan batan yan iladzun udan be maso yia yina hakika ufea sai de gan gba jin ci naa tu la na
 Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth and all that Allah hath created Do they not see that it may well be that their terms is nigh drawing to an end In what message after this will they then believe,Kashi acin le lo eba mulki yan sanmazhi to kin yina to iri yandondo na Soko jin jin naa uma jin wo gan ajali azhie laa tso ba niTo egan ki ci baci wuncino ke na yea jin imani be yin nao
To such as Allah rejects from His guidance there can be no guide He will leave them in their trespasses wandering in distraction,Zaeni ndondo na Soko gau gbin na ade zan dondo naa lau kr eko wo naa uci gaa ya gun egbinazhio eza zhi zhi ci zhi
They ask thee about the final Hour - when will be its appointed time Say The knowledge thereof is with my Lord alone None but He can reveal as to when it will occur Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth Only all of a sudden will it come to you They ask thee as if thou Wert eager in search thereof Say The knowledge thereof is with Allah alone but most men know not,Egbin wyo gan eti eka yan ekin na kiyamao foci wunajin tabbattao Gan gan hakika de kpi kpeu dan be tso ci mi yin Zandondo danbo najin bayani lokaciu wo naa sai de wyun tso Alamariu wuna lukpin dan mini samazhio to kin bo Umaa be ya yea sai de eti girikuo Acia fe gbin wyo gan ke wyoa ye gan ko wyo de kpi kpeu de na Gan gan hakika de kpi kpeu dan be Sokoe amma de ekun don do zawangizhi ade kpikpe
Say I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as Allah willeth If I had knowledge of the unseen I should have multiplied all good and no evil should have touched me I am but a warner and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith,Gan gan mi de mulki yan eti tacin mi yan eyan anfani ndocia mima da eyan gun ndoci gwa wo ya eti tacin mi yina sai de yanna ga ba Soko uc jin na Da aci gan mi de kpikpe gaybu de yan naa swo na da mia dokun be jin jin alheri ganani eyan egun ndondo maa tomi gwaa mi de fea sai de gan gba jin ci Mimae ya labari yan gban fa ya jamaa na zhi gae jin imani na
It is He Who created you from a single person and made his mate of like nature in order that he might dwell with her in love When they are united she bears a light burden and carries it about unnoticed When she grows heavy they both pray to Allah their Lord saying If Thou givest us a goodly child we vow we shall ever be grateful,Wyun ga yi Etsu na jin alitta ye dagan rayi ninio na Ucia yiwo jin yau dagan minia tso ebo ude bau fa yangbanu dan miniubo Kamina ubea nakan laa kpe una wuna de wan ewan na yi finfanci na uci fe lo yegboro beu yin Gancin kamina nakan bea lukpin na acia ya Soko aduwa yn ba Etsu nayi Tsoci na Hakika wyo ga ya yi egi guru de ma hakika yi gaafe dan mini zanazhie jin yebo nao
 But when He giveth them a goodly child they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received but Allah is exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him,To kamina Soko bea eyan wangi laaya naa yandonci ko zandonci laapau baci dan mini yanna ula yaanao Soko maa latu ke yannazhie la pau baci na lugwa
Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing but are themselves created,Kashiala yanna jin alitta yandondo woa na apau baci alalima ajin alitta yan atso jin
 No aid can they give them nor can they aid themselves!,Ama la eyan taimako ndondo yaa woa atso ma jin  ti ta acina taimako woa
If ye call them to guidance they will not obey For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace!,Ka yema ga yian lo eko bawu aa alamitu ye niuyi yaye yeo ko ye yia ko ma ye laefe zanazhia sunsun na!
 If ye call them to guidance they will not obey For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace!,Ka yema ga yian lo eko bawu aa alamitu ye niuyi yaye yeo ko ye yia ko ma ye laefe zanazhia sunsun na!
Verily those whom ye call upon besides Allah are servants like unto you Call upon them and let them listen to your prayer if ye are indeed truthful!,Hakika zanazhi ye da yi ye ke Soko lugwa na wuzhizhi ayio dozhin ye tso zhio to efe yia-ye gancin ma ala ye yea gwo mi ala aduwa yezhia gwo wunayi za gaskiyazhi ye yio na
Have they feet to walk with Or hands to lay hold with Or eyes to see with Or ears to hear with Say Call your ´god-partners´ scheme your worst against me and give me no respite!,Kashi ade bici ezando yan gwaatso de nae laa dazan na Kashi ade egwa yangwaatso de nae laa wan yan na Kashi ade eyezhi de yangwaatso nae la lebaye na Kashi ade tukpazhi de yan gwatsozhi nae laa wangan Eyi yannazhi ye laa pa Soko baci na beyn gancin ye cie tso tangi yan tanadi dede ye ya Mi ye mae ga shi tukpa ndondo ya Mima
For my Protector is Allah Who revealed the Book from time to time and He will choose and befriend the righteous,Hakika Soko ga yi Ndakata mi yano Etsu nacin litafi be na Wyun ga mayi Etsu nae gwogwa ya za guruzhi nao
 But those ye call upon besides Him are unable to help you and indeed to help themselves,Za nazhi ma ye da yi ye ke Soko lugwa na ajin ye taimako ndondo woa ama jin eti taso taimako woa
 If thou callest them to guidance they hear not Thou wilt see them looking at thee but they see not,Ka ye ma ga yia lo eko bawu awoa Wyo ma alea ye afe cin wyo le amaa le yando yea
Hold to forgiveness command what is right But turn away from the ignorant,Agwa sun yan na ga fan gan na fe fa be zazhi wyo mao feo jin foro be tun alheri wyo mao la etio panoke bojin yan jahilizhio lugwa
If a suggestion from Satan assail thy mind seek refuge with Allah for He heareth and knoweth all things,Ko ma kandondo na wyo gae wo fifela ko ma sharya fu  yan shetan cie wagan wyuna fe wyo la na dada wa tswitswa be Sokoe hakika Soko Etsu nae wo na uyio Etsu na ma kpikpe na Uyio
Those who fear Allah when a thought of evil from Satan assaults them bring Allah to remembrance when lo! they see aright!,Hakika za nazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundanu na kandondo na yekpa dede ndoci yan shetan ga be yaa na ajin a pa Soko gancin aci gaafe eza basirazhi eza hankalizhi
But their brethren the evil ones plunge them deeper into error and never relax their efforts,Za nazhi mae sundan Sokoa na yegiazhi mini shetanzhio ajin afe jina taimako dan mini egbino amae cin faa
If thou bring them not a revelation they say Why hast thou not got it together Say I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord this is nothing but lights from your Lord and Guidance and mercy for any who have faith,Kagan ma wyo la aya ndoci be yaa agan Ki la wyo tso ci tswa yan gwa wyoa yano GanganHakika de mie la mi latu wahayi naga be yami dagan eba Tsoci mi bo na Nanaegan hankalizhia ayio dagan eba Tsoci yebo umayi bawu be ye guny ya jamaa nazhi gae jin imani na
When the Qur´an is read listen to it with attention and hold your peace that ye may receive Mercy,Kandondo na ma agae gba katun Alkuranu na efe shi tukpa yan ye mae sunsun ujin wo be wunciny ye gade yegun
And do thou O reader! Bring thy Lord to remembrance in thy very soul with humility and in reverence without loudness in words in the mornings and evenings and be not thou of those who are unheedful,Wyo mao feo tun Tsoci wyo yao ye dan mini yangban wyo bo be ekpedae to be dansuny zunmanci yan egan la tuo to lazhin to lozun wyo mao gaafe dan mini eye yaci zhio ma
Those who are near to thy Lord disdain not to do Him worship They celebrate His praises and prostrate before Him,Hakika ma zanazhi dan eba Tsoci wyo bo na e gbo tika ke jin jin bauta Soko lugwaa amaajin afe liu be ekundo yan Tasbihuy Wyun ga ajin ajin sujada yao
A questioner asked about a Penalty to befall-,Egan gbinci gbin gan eti azaba nan Soko jin kafiri zhi alkawali nanSurah  The Unbelievers the which there is none to ward off-Azaba na-nan nan Sokoa jin kafirizhi nan alitta ndondo danbo nan dau gwa ya wo naa
A Penalty from Allah Lord of the Ways of Ascent,Azaba na-nan dagan eba Soko bou fe beo Nan gbanu be etanu yin ma gan dozhi
 The angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a Day the measure whereof is as fifty thousand years,Malaikazhi to malaika jibreeluajin a fe gun lo fiti Eba Soko ezana yan foe ni uyi dai dai be ezan eya kpuutsun danna da araa tae yan eya izhe nan nan eya kpa arata
 Therefore do thou hold Patience- a Patience of beautiful contentment,Annabi a hakuri jin hakuri nan yi wangi nan
 They see the Day indeed as a far-off event,Akika kafirizhi ajin a fe le azaba Soko ye ke yan nan a kpe ya bea yin nan
But We see it quite near,Yi Soko mane leu ye yan na atsoba sarauyin nan
The Day that the sky will be like molten brass,Efoe be dano nan nan sama gaafe ke azarfa ko emi nana zun nanSurah And the mountains will be like woolPati to takun zhi kpata ci ga fe ke eyin nan
 And no friend will ask after a friend,Efo wuncin a de masoyi naa gbin gan ba nan masoyiu dan naa

 Inviting all such as turn their backs and turn away their faces from the Right,Wuna jin u fe kpo gun yi za nana zunma zheta Soko nan Ucia jin kafirinci be bawu Sokoe nan

 Fretful when evil touches him,Mi man cinle ndoci yan yangban yin ga deu wune jin hakuria

Not so those devoted to Prayer-,Sai dai za nan zhie jin sallah nanezhe wuna a mae tanyan boa
 Those who remain steadfast to their prayer,Za nanzhi yangbanazhi a shi dan jin jin sallao kandondo nan
And those in whose wealth is a recognised right,To za nanzhie la hakki yan Soko nan dan dukiyaa zhio nan wa nanke zakka be sadakae nan
For the needy who asks and him who is prevented for some reason from asking,E laa wa ya talaka nane bayan za nan be talaka nan dea u ma yangban wu wune bayana nan

 And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord-,To za nanzhi a jin a fe sundan azaba Tsocia nan
For their Lord´s displeasure is the opposite of Peace and Tranquillity-,Akika Azaba yan Soko u jin yan nan ezaa ya aminci be yin naa
 And those who guard their chastity,To za nanzhie la kangi dan itaa zhi ke zina lugwa nan
 And those who guard their chastity,To za nanzhie la kangi dan itaa zhi ke zina lugwa nan
Except with their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess- for then they are not to be blamed,Sai dai ganni be yinmiazhi ko wuzhi inzagizhi nan a ga de eti ekun addini Musuluncio nan akika leifi u dan mini ema nan yea wo bea yin nana
But those who trespass beyond this are transgressors-,Zaeni ndondo nan ga -- iyaka nna zhii gan nan akika za wuncin zhi gae gbin iyaka Soko tu o

Such will be the honoured ones in the Gardens of Bliss,Kpata za wuncin zhi za cin wanci zhi ayio fi mini aljannaazhio
 Now what is the matter with the Unbelievers that they rush madly before thee-,Ke jin kafiri zhi cia jin a fe jin dalodazhin zhi yegboro wyo bo
 From the right and from the left in crowds,Acia jin a gunye kan ekpo ekpo to gwalo to gwapin
 Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss,Kashi zaeni ndondo miniabo e wa wa gan a la wuna la ganadan aljannao U ma yi be etun guru ndondo yina
By no means! For We have created them out of the base matter they know!,Wuna ye jin acina Akika ye zawangizhi yetso kpe yan nan Mi Soko a jin alitta ye nan Ebo acino alfahri ndoci u dan bo nan yea jin fi Soko naa
 Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We can certainly-,Mi Soko e zhi kuti be Etsu nan wun mulki ta eti eyi laa zhin to lozunI nan Yi gboka eti jin jin yandondo
 Substitute for them better men than they And We are not to be defeated in Our Plan,Na Yigaa sangwa Yi cii la halitta woro zhii jin nanzhi de alhairi gana nan Akika alitta ndondo gan Yi gwa woa

 So He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a stated Term for when the Term given by Allah is accomplished it cannot be put forward if ye only knew,Soko a fa be zunubie zhii U maa pata alhairi yae har da lokaci nan yi kikaci nan Akika eka yan Soko gaa gun aa pau taa Daaci gan ye de akika kpikpe alamari nan nan de da ye ga imani jin be Sokoe
 He said O my Lord! I have called to my People night and day,Annabi Nuhu gan Tsoci Mie yi za ba mizhi be eko addini Musulunci to yeshi to yigidi
 But my call only increases their flight from the Right,Yi-yi mi zhi kpata ma u bea yandoa sai kpikpeya be gaskiyae
And every time I have called to them that Thou mightest forgive them they have only thrust their fingers into their ears covered themselves up with their garments grown obstinate and given themselves up to arrogance,Akika ma kandondo nan mi ga yia ebo wo jina gafara nan a ga egwa gin-ginia zhi ku fi tukpa zhio aci ga edeazhi kpeti a ci ga kpe ta eti lefi jino acia fe gbotika nana -- iyaka gan nanSo I have called to them aloudMi mae kezhe yia lokaci nan a ga zhi tacin jamaa zhio nan

 And they have said to each other ´Abandon not your gods Abandon neither Wadd nor Suwa´ neither Yaguth nor Ya´uq nor Nasr´-,Nunsazhi cia gan yagan e ga kara jin yarda yea gan be kutie zhi ma E ga kpe ya be waddae ma ye mae ga kpe ya be kuti suwaae ma to kuti yagusu to kuti yauka to kuti NASRA kpata ya egwa suna gbanyin be jin jin bauta
They have already misled many and grant Thou no increase to the wrong-doers but in straying from their mark,Akika a ekun dondo yan zazhi ku fi egbino Ebo acino Soko mie ba be wyo yin ga la yandondo be azwalumi zhi ma sai egbin be hallakae
Because of their sins they were drowned in the flood and were made to enter the Fire of Punishment and they found- in lieu of Allah- none to help them,Ebo iri lefi nanzhi a fe jin nan Tsoci a jin hallaka be nuwan yan TUFANUI Gancin Soko Soko cia ku fi enano A ma de zandondo nana jina taimako baci Soko nana
 And Noah said O my Lord! Leave not of the Unbelievers a single one on earth!,Annabi Nuhu ci ba aduwa be Sokoe Tsoci ga lu emi ko nini gwa ya kafiri zhi ta eti kinbo ma
For if Thou dost leave any of them they will but mislead Thy devotees and they will breed none but wicked ungrateful ones,Akika Soko wo ga kafirizhi ya kpe kinbo a ga wuzhi wyozhi ku fi egbino Zuriyaazhi ma ga fe lefi jin ci zhi kafirizhi
O my Lord! Forgive me my parents all who enter my house in Faith and all believing men and believing women and to the wrong-doers grant Thou no increase but in perdition!,Tsoci fa be mi yin Wyo mao fa be yanmanci mizhii Wyo mao fa be zandondo nan ga dan emi mi bo U ma yi mumini nan Wyo mao fa be Muminizhii kpata to bagi to inzagi Wyo mao ga la yandondo be azwalumi zhi ma sai dai zunyesun be hallakae to izhe to eku
 Say It has been revealed to me that a company of Jinns listened to the Qur´an They said ´We have really heard a wonderful Recital!,Annabi Gan ya alumma wo zhi gan Tsoci jin wahyi ya Mi ke jamaa yan jannuzhi a shi tukpa ya gbigba yan Alkuranu nan aci gan Akika yi shi tukpa ya katun Alkuranu nan yi eyan mamaki u mae din hankali za nan
´It gives guidance to the Right and we have believed therein we shall not join in worship any gods with our Lord,Alkuranu Wune jin zawangizhi shiri lo eko wangi ebo acino Yia imani jin beu yin yi maa kaa ra la yandondo ko zandondo pa Soko nan yi Tsoci yi nan baci bea
´And Exalted is the Majesty of our Lord He has taken neither a wife nor a son,Akika Tsoci yi nan wancin nan Wuna li ke aibu kpata lugwa U de yin mina U ma de egia
´There were some foolish ones among us who used to utter extravagant lies against Allah,Akika ma a de wa-wa ndoci zhi fi mini yibo ajin a fe gan gan naa -- iyaka gan nan eti Soko
´But we do think that no man or spirit should say aught that untrue against Allah,Akika pa yinnan Yi kpa ye gan zawangi danbo ko aljani nana zun ganmanan ta Soko naa
´True there were persons among mankind who took shelter with persons among the Jinns but they increased them in folly,Akika a de zandoci zhi mini zawangizhio ajin a fe wa cigbe yan etswa dagan eba aljani ndocihio Wuncin nane jin nan u bea yandocia sai egbin be hallakae
 ´And they came to think as ye thought that Allah would not raise up any one to Judgment,Akika a de dan mini zawangi zhio kendoe a de dan mini yetso jannuzhionan nanzhie jin za to ke Sokoa san zawangizhi ba ci ajali bo bea nan
´And we pried into the secrets of heaven but we found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires,Akika yi jannuzhi gun lo sanma yi ci da tsun a sanma she be malaikazhi nanzhie pau nan to enan nane jin za hallaka nan
 ´We used indeed to sit there in hidden stations to steal a hearing but any who listen now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush,Akika ma yi yi be edunfe bazhi paa yin dan sanmao nan yi ya jin yi fe shitukpa egan zhi nan Am ma zaeni ndondo nan ga lo tukpa-shi-zhi gbani nan a gau jin hallaka ganni be enae
 ´And we understand not whether ill is intended to those on earth or whether their Lord really intends to guide them to right conduct,Akika yi jannu zhi ma yi kpea ko Tsocie kpa sharri ndoci kpa be za nanzhi kpe kinbo nan kash wune kpakpa gan wuna laake eko guru
 ´There are among us some that are righteous and some the contrary we follow divergent paths,Akika mini yi jannu zhio za guru zhi nanzhie sundan Soko nan danbo Ama de nanzhi e sundan Sokoa nan Akika Yi jannu zhi a fe eza ka-ka yin Musulumizhi to kafirizhi
´But we think that we can by no means frustrate Allah throughout the earth nor can we frustrate Him by flight,Yi ma gaskiya ya ke zaeni ndondo gan Soko gwa kin bo bee ci yina na
´And as for us since we have listened to the Guidance we have accepted it and any who believes in his Lord has no fear either of a short account or of any injustice,Akika lokaci nan Yi wo bawu yan Alkurani nan yia imani jin beu yin Akika zandondo nan ga imani jin be Tsociu yin nan Wuna sundan kike yan tsunwan etun guru wuna U maa sundan bibe yan tsun wan etun dedeu zhia
´Amongst us are some that submit their wills to Allah and some that swerve from justice Now those who submit their wills - they have sought out the path of right conduct,Akika mini yibo a de Musulumi guru zhi nan zhia kpatsun ta ya foro Soko baenio nan a ma de eza kandan zhi fi mini yibo Akika zandondo nan ga kpatsun ta ya foro Soko nan za wuncin zhi ga ta eti eko shiri bo
 ´But those who swerve- they are but fuel for Hell-fire´-,Akika za nanzhi a kan ke eko Soko lugwa nan a ga yi cigban tun yan jahanna mao
 ´But those who swerve- they are but fuel for Hell-fire´-,Akika za nanzhi a kan ke eko Soko lugwa nan a ga yi cigban tun yan jahanna mao
And Allah´s Message is If they the Pagans had only remained on the right Way We should certainly have bestowed on them Rain in abundance,Daacigan alittazhi a kpe-kpe gikini eti sharia Soko daa yi a ya nuwan fin nan dokun nanU ga yi arziki nan dokun albarkao nao
That We might try them by that means But if any turns away from the remembrance of his Lord He will cause him to undergo a severe Penalty,Yi ga arziki la ya ye Ebo yi ma ye yi cini le zandondo nan ga pan ya ke pi pa Tsociu lugwa nan Tsoci gau laa dan mini azaba nanzhi tan sarauyin nan
And the places of worship are for Allah alone So invoke not any one along with Allah,Akika dan nan nan zhi e jin sujada dan nan ke masallaci zhi nan yan Soko gbuugi ayio ebo acino e ga fe da yi za ndoci ye a pa ma be Sokoe ma
 Yet when the Devotee of Allah stands forth to invoke Him they just make round him a dense crowd,Akika lokaci nan wuzhi Soko Annabi Muhammadu a ku gikini fe wun Soko be kuranu gbae nan jannu zhi fejin ke a ga mu bou nan
 Say I do no more than invoke my Lord and I join not with Him any false god,Annabi Gan ya gan Akika Tsoci mi gbuugi ga mie jin bauta yao Mi ma la yandondo a pau bacia
Say I do no more than invoke my Lord and I join not with Him any false god,Annabi Gan ya gan Akika Tsoci mi gbuugi ga mie jin bauta yao Mi ma la yandondo a pau bacia
Say It is not in my power to cause you harm or to bring you to right conduct,Akika Mi Annabi mi kan gwa egu ndondo ya ye woa Mi ma la alhairi ndondo ya ye woa alamari zhi kpata to yan mi to yan ye fi egwa Soko
 Say No one can deliver me from Allah If I were to disobey Him nor should I find refuge except in Him,Annabi Gan ya gan zaeni ndondo miniebo U gan mi gwa wo ke azaba Soko lugwaa Mi ma de eba zaeni ndondo a bici loa sai eba Soko
 Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His Messages for any that disobey Allah and His Messenger- for them is Hell they shall dwell therein for ever,Yannan a ganmi gwa eba Soko nan U ga yi eyan wu da gan eba Soko be yan nanzhiu laa tun mi tun fie nan Akika zaeni ndondo nan gae le foro Soko be Tuciu yin ba nan enan yan jahannama gajin tabbata yau a maa fi nin yinu bo har abada
At length when they see with their own eyes that which they are promised- then will they know who it is that is weakest in his helper and least important in point of numbers,Efo nan za nan zhie la yan pa Soko ba ci nan a ga azaba nan Sokoe jina alkawali nan le ye nan Fo wuncin a kpe za nan ga togbogun gan eba kagbo to eba ekundo nan
 Say I know not whether the Punishment which ye are promised is near or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term,Annabi Gan ya gan Mi kpe akika yan efo nan Sokoe jine alkawali gan wuna be naa ko yan nan Tsoba nan uyio kashi yan nan yi fo jin re nan uyio
 He alone knows the Unseen nor does He make any one acquainted with His Mysteries-,Soko ga wun kpikpe yan nana so nano zandondo danbo nan kpe gaibu ye nana sai Soko
 Except a messenger whom He has chosen and then He makes a band of watchers march before him and behind him,Sai dai za nan U ga jin yarda ya mini Tucio nan Uci ga malaika nanzhia fe tswau nan laa danu yegboro to zun mao
 That He may know that they have truly brought and delivered the Messages of their Lord and He surrounds all the mysteries that are with them and takes account of every single thing,Ebo Soko ulau wu halitta zhi ke Tucizhi a e yan yan Tsocia zhi wu ya za zhi nan Soko maa alamaria zhi kpata ma kezhe U ma kezhe yi be lisafi yandondoe gungunci
O thou folded in garments!,Ya wyoe Annabi na a ede lakpe ba nan
Stand to prayer by night but not all night-,A nan kin dan jin jin ibadao be yeshi kpaata sai dai lokaci degi ga woa fao
 Half of it- or a little less,A gan-fi yeshi jin sallah kpaata Ko ma u lau gba gan fi yeshi degi
 Or a little more and recite the Qur´an in slow measured rhythmic tones,koma wo feo jin sallaho dan lokaci nan a be ta eti gan-fi yeshio nan Wo mao feo gba Alkuranu gbi gba nan yi wangi nan
 Soon shall We send down to thee a weighty Message,Akika yi Sokoa la kara yanegan nan lukpin sarauyin nan ta wyoekara adini
Truly the rising by night is most potent for governing the soul and most suitable for framing the Word of Prayer and Praise,Akika ekin nan dan jin jin ibadao be yeshii Wune ya za yangban cin ta nan wancin Uma jin dai dai gan eba eza nan ezaaba be Tsociu yin nae
 True there is for thee by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties,Akika wo yi be etun nanzhii dokun nan eti eko lili yan Soko be yigidii
 But keep in remembrance the name of thy Lord and devote thyself to Him whole-heartedly,Wyo mao dokun be yetun yan Tsocio yin Wyo mao la tacino tu baenio Dan jin jin ibadao ya Soko
He is Lord of the East and the West there is no god but He take Him therefore for thy Disposer of Affairs,Tsoci nan wun mulki eyi lazhin nan to eyi lozun nan akika a de za ndoci ko yandoci nan kuna cin a jin bauta ya naa sai dai Soko Ebo acino a gwa sun Soko gban yin
And have patience with what they say and leave them with noble dignity,Wyo mao la hakurio jin be egan banza nanzhie gan nan wyo mao kpeo ya beayin kpikpeya nan yi wangi nan Ga jina zwalunci ma Wyo mao ga gia toko ma
 And leave Me alone to deal with those in possession of the good things of life who yet deny the Truth and bear with them for a little while,Annabi a Mi Soko ya ganni be za nanzhie yi alamari adini ganmanan nan ebo nan a yi be niima izhe nan wo mao patao yaa degi woa le yan nan Soko ajin bea yin nan ye
 With Us are Fetters to bind them and a Fire to burn them,AkikaYia shiri yan kuruzhi nan lukpin sarauyin nan jin kaa kiyamao to enan nan tan sarauyin nan

 And a Food that chokes and a Penalty Grievous,To yangici dede nane yi gan zakumu nan ganna be azaba nan tan sarauyin nan
One Day the earth and the mountains will be in violent commotion And the mountains will be as a heap of sand poured out and flowing down,Efo kiyama Efo u yio nan kin to patizhi a fe du dudu yan iyaka nan Patizhi ci ga zhe ke jikanna nana ku ye kan zhi-zhi nan wuna de kagbo ndondo bea
We have sent to you O men! a messenger to be a witness concerning you even as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh,Akika Yia Tuci tun fi ye Ebo u lau fe eriu ya etun nanzhi yelo nan kendoe Yi tun Tuci fi Firauna na
But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so We seized him with a heavy Punishment,Firauna cia le bawu yan Tuci Soko ba Yi ciu wan winwan nan yi kpantsuku nan
Then how shall ye if ye deny Allah guard yourselves against a Day that will make children hoary-headed-,Ke yea be jin jin be kafirinci nan ye jin be Sokoe nan efo kiyamae nano Efo wuncin nan ebo ekpin luu bo wune la dzakangizhi a yin tin yin bokun nano

Thy Lord doth know that thou standest forth to prayer nigh two-thirds of the night or half the night or a third of the night and so doth a party of those with thee But Allah doth appoint night and day in due measure He knoweth that ye are unable to keep count thereof So He hath turned to you in mercy read ye therefore of the Qur´an as much as may be easy for you He knoweth that there may be some among you in ill-health others travelling through the land seeking of Allah´s bounty yet others fighting in Allah´s Cause read ye therefore as much of the Qur´an as may be easy for you and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity and loan to Allah a Beautiful Loan And whatever good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find it in Allah´s Presence- yea better and greater in Reward and seek ye the Grace of Allah for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,Akika Tsoci wyoe de kpikpe ke Wyoe nan kin jin ibada ke ekpa-lo yan kansan guba yan yeshii nan kandoci ma kasan nini yan guta yan yeshii Ganni be sashi za nan zhia imani jin be wo yin nan Akika Soko ga wun iko eti ekpa-lo yan yeshi to igidi bo Soko kpe ke ye de kagbo nan ye ga jin ibada yeshii kpata naa ebo acino wuna sauki jin ya ye Da gan gbani e fe jin sallah yeshi to katun alkuranu gwargwado kendoe u ga fan fie nan Soko kpe ke aabe de za nanzhia wo maa miniebo nan ebo acino a jin sallah yeshi woa Ndocizhi maa fe jin kodagba za kpe eti kinbo a a fe wa arziki za dagan eba Soko ndocizhi ma afe jin jihadi dan kinbo ebo adini Sokou lau lau tu Ebo acino ejin Sallah yeshi be Alkuranu gbae gwargwado nan ga fan fie nan Ye mae la salla farillazhie kuegikini wangi ye mae fe wa zakka dukiya yezhi Ye mae fe la eyan wangi ye zhi Ye lae ma Soko eti sadakao Yandondo nan Ye ga la shidzo yan alhairi nan Yea be tsunu eba Soko be egagba na wancin

And We have set none but angels as Guardians of the Fire and We have fixed their number only as a trial for Unbelievers- in order that the People of the Book may arrive at certainty and the Believers may increase in Faith- and that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the Believers and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the Unbelievers may say What symbol doth Allah intend by this Thus doth Allah leave to stray whom He pleaseth and guide whom He pleaseth and none can know the forces of thy Lord except He and this is no other than a warning to mankind,Akika za nan zhi yi la gan afea tswa enan nan Malaika zhi a yio Adadiaa za shi din nni nan yi tun ye nan fitana tsa u yi ya kafiri zhio Ebo za nan zhia la litafi ya nan a be gaskiya ya be Annabi to Alkuranu U mau la u fe bibe yan imaniu ya Muminizhi A maa ga fe jin kelo-ke-zhi dan adadi yan Mulaika zhio ma

And the moon is buried in darkness,haske yan etswa ci dau da nan eba ciga shizhiko

 Move not thy tongue concerning the Qur´an to make haste therewith,Annabi ga fe jin mini wyoe bauta be gbi gba yan Alkuranui elo be zhini ma Wyo mao ga dinye be ku ku fi tiu yin ma

In the thought that some back-breaking calamity was about to be inflicted on them,A fe tuye gan acin masiba wanciko nane ban tsukun zunma nan taa
 Yea when the soul reaches to the collar-bone in its exit,Aa akika lokaci nan rayi zawangi gaa tun mako-- ro nan
And there will be a cry Who is a magician to restore him,kanga ezau zhi a fe gan gan Zii kpe cigbe ye wangi nana sa batan nan nan nano

That Day the Drive will be all to thy Lord!,E zan nan dan biciu bo fo wuncin nan sai eba Tsoci wyo bo wuna da cinoko Aljanna ko enan

Does man think that he will be left uncontrolled without purpose,Zawangie kpa ye kpa gan Soko u la wunu yake banza nan
 Was he not a drop of sperm emitted in lowly form,A sha ujin dagan manii bo a jin hallita wuna
 Then did he become a leech-like clot then did Allah make and fashion him in due proportion,Kanga Uci bea zhe egya tsuntsun ci Soko cia hallitau jin wangi a

For the Rejecters we have prepared chains yokes and a blazing Fire,Akika Yia shiri jin ka kafirizhi be dzarii to kuru to enan yan Sairui
As to the Righteous they shall drink of a Cup of Wine mixed with Kafur-,Akika eza kirkizhi a fe fin nuwan mannan gizhi nan a zhin keba be kafurui nan
A Fountain where the Devotees of Allah do drink making it flow in unstinted abundance,Kafurnan nan nuwan mannan gi uyio nan wuzhi Soko guru zhi a fe de yana fin kandondo nan
 They perform their vows and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and wide,Za nanzhie la tun lo eti emi nanzhi a ga she be Soko enan A maajin a fe sundan efo nan sharriu dokun nan Efo kiyama dano nan
They perform their vows and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and wide,Za nanzhie la tun lo eti emi nanzhi a ga she be Soko enan A maajin a fe sundan efo nan sharriu dokun nan Efo kiyama dano nan
 And they feed for the love of Allah the indigent the orphan and the captive-,A maa jin a fe la yangici ya eza gwagbagizhi be ekungi zhi to za nanzhi a ga wan ekundao nan alhaliI maa tso yi be bukatau yin
SayingWe feed you for the sake of Allah alone no reward do we desire from you nor thanks,Acia jin a fe gangan Akika Yi ye ya ye yangici yagi ebo wiwa yan yarda Soko Yi mae wa egagba ndoci ko yebo jin dagan eba ye boa
We only fear a Day of distressful Wrath from the side of our Lord,Akika Yie sundan azaba dagan eba Tsoci yibo yan efo nan fuska ekundondo zazhi gaa shizhiko nan Efo nan lukpin sarauyin nan
 But Allah will deliver them from the evil of that Day and will shed over them a Light of Beauty and blissful Joy,Soko cia gan gwa be sharri yan efo wuncin Ucia la gun be haske ganni be yangban fae
 And because they were patient and constant He will reward them with a Garden and garments of silk,Soko cia egagba wangi laa yaa yan aljanna be tufuwa yan silki zhii ebo hakuri nan a fe jin eti emi latu foro Soko nan
Reclining in the Garden on raised thrones they will see there neither the sun´s excessive heat nor the moon´s excessive cold,Aci ga kpetso ta eti gadoa zhio mini aljannao awo ba nan guna amaa wo bayeko tsuntsun nua
And the shades of the Garden will come low over them and the bunches of fruit there will hang low in humility,Wuru yan cigban aljannazhi gaa tso baa aci ga to yangici sun-sunu zhi lazhin kin baenio
And amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and goblets of crystal-,A maa fe mana kezhe be evo yan azarfa zhii yan yangici mannangi zhi to kopu zhi nan zhie ban nan nan
Crystal-clear made of silver they will determine the measure thereof according to their wishes,Evo wuncin zhi a jin-a-jin be azarfae aciu dan tsunwan be gwargwado bukata zandondoe
And they will be given to drink there of a Cup of Wine mixed with Zanjabil,#NAME?
A fountain there called Salsabil,Nuwan ndoci ke danbo nan e yi gan salsabiila nan nan egi aljanna zhi a de fin nan
And round about them will serve youths of perpetual freshness If thou seest them thou wouldst think them scattered Pearls,Egi wawagi ndoci zhi afe maegi mi aljanna zhi kezhe egi wuncin zhi a ga jin tabbata ta eti dzakan boa bo be egyea bo Wyo ga la eye cina le Wyoa ye gan ko aluluizhio nana gaya zhi-zhi nan
And when thou lookest it is there thou wilt see a Bliss and a Realm Magnificent,Wyo ga yan nanzhi fi aljannao nan leye wyoa le eyan niima iri-iri zhi ye ganni be mulki nan wanci sarauyin nan
Upon them will be green Garments of fine silk and heavy brocade and they will be adorned with Bracelets of silver and their Lord will give to them to drink of a Wine Pure and Holy,Tufuwa nan tso latu gan nanu ga yi yan silikio nuwan aliga U mae ban nan Aci gaa panin be azarfa zhi Baci wuncino acia ke zhe yaa nuwan lilici zhi fin

 It is We Who have sent down the Qur´an to thee by stagesAkika Yi ga cin Alkuranu be ya wyo nini ninio,
 Therefore be patient with constancy to the Command of thy Lord and hearken not to the sinner or the ingrate among them,Annabi a hakuri jin be hukunci nanzhi Tsoci wyoe la ya wyo nan Wyo mao ga la mitu za nanzhie le Soko ba to kafirizhi na ma
 And celebrate the name of thy Lord morning and evening,Wyo mao feo dokun be yetuu yan Tsoci Wyo yin to lazhin to lozun
And part of the night prostrate thyself to Him and glorify Him a long night through,Eye gaashi fe dokun be jin jin yan sujadae Wyo mao feo li Soko lokaci nan lokpa nan dan mini yeshio
As to these they love the fleeting life and put away behind them a Day that will be hard,Akika kafirizhi to munafikizhi za wuncin zhi kpata izhe nan fanyin zo nan ugaee de cin cin yao acia efo nan tso lukpin sarauyin nan yaci zunmao
 It is We Who created them and We have made their joints strong but when We will We can substitute the like of them by a complete change,Yi ga jin alittaa o Yicia kagbo laa dan gaba-gaba zhio U ga ba Yi Yi ga jin hallaka Yici ga zandoci zhi jin nanzhia fe jin bauta ya Soko nan

This is an admonition Whosoever will let him take a straight Path to his Lord,Akika aya nan nan zhi tukpa pa ayio za nanu ga ba nan ula gwau sun etun guruzhiu feulo U mau ta eti eko nan Tsociu la cici nan
 But ye will not except as Allah wills for Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom,Yandondo nan ma gae ba ye nan sai u ga ba Soko shidzo bedzo Akika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Egba u ma yi dan jin jin yandondo bo
 He will admit to His Mercy whom He will But the wrong-doers- for them has He prepared a grievous Penalty,Sokoa jin u la za nan ga bau na aa gandan mini yegunu bo Soko ma shiri yan azaba nan tan nan jin ka 
By the Winds sent forth one after another to man´s profit,Sokoe zhi kuti be efe azaba nanzhi a jin a fe la mitu dozhi nan

 Then spread abroad a Message,U mae zhi kuti be malaika nane la tukpapa lo da ya Annabi zhi nan
 Whether of Justification or of Warning-,Ebo uzuri ndoci nan dan be ayin nan ko ebo gangba be ewun nane
Assuredly what ye are promised must come to pass,Akika yan nanzhi Sokoe la jin ye alkawali nan kpatau gaa jin faruwa

When the heaven is cleft asunder,Lokaci nan a ga to sanma ban fi nan
 When the mountains are scattered to the winds as dust,Lokaci nan patizhi to takun zhi kpata gala ruku nan

 Ah woe that Day to the Rejecters of Truth!,Azaba yan hallaka wuna jin tabbata ya za nanzhi a alamari addini musulumci la ganmanan na fo wuncin
 Did We not destroy the men of old for their evil,Ngba eza mafari nanzhi shidzo be lefi Sokoe nan Yi jina hallakaa

 Ah woe that Day to the Rejecters of Truth!,Azaba yan hallaka wuna jin tabbata ya za nanzhia alamari adinni musulunci yi ganmanan nan fo wuncin
 Have We not created you from a fluid held despicable-,A sha Yi jin alitta ye jin dagan nuwan gbigba ci boa
The which We placed in a place of rest firmly fixed,Yi cia manii laa fi mini eba ndocio nan de aminci nanu ga yi ewano
For a period of gestation determined according to need,Har da lokaci ndoci nan yi eyan kpikpeci eba Sokoo nan
For We do determine according to need for We are the best to determine things,Yi cia iko laa wu maadanla be Etsu nan wun iko u ma de kagbo eti jin jin yandondo nan

 It will be said Depart ye to that which ye used to reject as false!,Acia gana gan e be da tsun azaba jahannama nan ye fe yi ganmanan izheo nan
 Depart ye to a Shadow of smoke ascending in three columns,E fe lo da gan dan mini wuru yan enan jahannamao nana kpe fi gwa la guta nan
Which yields no shade of coolness and is of no use against the fierce Blaze,Wuru uyio nan de anfani ndondoa nan U ma kan gwa enan azaba woa
Surah  Indeed it throws about sparks huge as Forts,Enan wuncin wuna jin u fe ce enan cikara yipa zhi nan cinwanazhi yi ke eban wanciko nan a tu gikini nan
 As if there were a string of yellow camels marching swiftly,Enan cikara yipa wuncin cia fe bici tinya jahannamao ke raakun yaran zhi nan
Ah woe that Day to the Rejecters of Truth!,Azaba yan hallaka wunajin tabbata fo wuncin ta eti za nanzhi ela alamari adini Musulunci ganmanan nan
 That will be a Day when they shall not be able to speak,Yinnan nan nan efo uyio nan egi mi nanzhi a de egan ndondo gana nano
Nor will it be open to them to put forth pleas,A yaa izini yan egan gano tsoa a cia gan gan uzuri ndocia
 Ah woe that Day to the Rejecters of Truth!,Azaba yan hallaka wunajin tabbata fo wuncin ta eti za nanzhi e la alamari adini Musulunci ganmanan nan
That will be a Day of Sorting out! We shall gather you together and those before you!,Yinnan ga yi efo eri kpe tsakani gaskiya be ganmanan yino Yi maa Ye kuye kana ni ganni be za mafari zhiebo egagbao
Now if ye have a trick or plot use it against Me!,Ye ga de tanadi ndoci de nan yea jin be mi yin nan e jin be yi le ye
 Ah woe that Day to the Rejecters of Truth!,Azaba yan hallaka wuna jin tabbata fo wuncin ta eti za nanzhi e la alamari adini musulunci ganmanan nan
As to the Righteous they shall be amidst cool shades and springs of water,Akika za nanzhie sundan Soko a mae tswa umurniu zhi nan a fi mini wuruo ganni be nuwan mannan gi zhi
 And they shall have fruits- all they desireTo yangici mari-mari zhi nan zhi a ga de shahawa a nan,
Eat ye and drink ye to your heart´s content for that ye worked Righteousness,Acia gana gan e fe gi ye mane fe fin yangban fa a yi ya ye yeo ebo iri etun wangi nanzhi ye fe lo izheo nan
 Thus do We certainly reward the Doers of Good,Akika acinga ga yia jin Yie la egagba wanciko ya za nanzhi gae lotun wangi nao
Ah woe that Day to the Rejecters of Truth!,Azaba yan hallaka wuna jin tabbata fo wuncin ta eti za nanzhi e la alamari adini musulunci ganmanan nano

 And when it is said to them Prostrate yourselves! they do not so,Ama gae gan ya gan e dakpya ya Soko eba jin jin yan sallao e yegan a dakpyaa
Ah woe that Day to the Rejecters of Truth!,Azaba yan hallaka wuna jin tabbata fo wuncin ta eti za nanzhie la alamari adini musulunci ganmanan nan
Then what Message after that will they believe in,Ka gan zawangi ya gaskiya be egan Alkuranu yina egan yan litafi ki ci ke wuna ya gaskiya be yin
 Concerning what are they disputing,Eti kibo kafirizhi egbin dozhi gan kandondoo
Concerning the Great News,Uyi eti labari na gbo uman wancin sarauyin nan
 About which they cannot agree,A cia fe zanazhie gbomi be dozhi etiubo nan
 Verily they shall soon come to know!,Aa alamari Soko yi acina ammaa yea be de kpikpe
Verily verily they shall soon come to ,know!Gaskiya uyio bele yin yea be de kpikpe
 Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse,Asa ujin yi gata kin cici ya ye para yina
And the mountains as pegs,Yimaa patizhi kangikini be kagboe yina
And have We not created you in pairs,Yimma alitta ye jin eba be yiwo yina
 And made your sleep for rest,Yima ele leye jin cia fe efa ya rayi ye yaa
 And made the night as a covering,Yima yeshi jin cia fe asiri swo ya ye yaa
 And made the day as a means of subsistence,Yima Yigidi jin cia fe lokaci yangici wa ya ye yaa
 And have We not built over you the seven firmaments,Yima kezhea saman gutwaba tuta fiti yebo be kagbo yina
And placed therein a Light of Splendour,Yima yigidi jin wuna fe haske wangi ya ye yaa
 And placed therein a Light of Splendour,Yima yigidi jin wuna fe haske wangi ya ye yaa
 And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance,Yimae du ele na dokun na be ya ye dagan shishi nyan sanmao
 That We may produce therewith corn and vegetables,Ebo yii la yangici lati yezhiu tinu yau ya yeSurah  And gardens of luxurious growthEbo cigban to fini lati yezhi ulau gye wangi
Verily the Day of Sorting out is a thing appointed,Akika efo egagba efo uyio na yibe lokaciu yin nan
The Day that the Trumpet shall be sounded and ye shall come forth in crowds,Efo uyio na a be busa fi mini kafoo nan zawangizhi cia fe tinya kabario jamaa-jamaazhi
 And the heavens shall be opened as if there were doors,Aciga sanma kpe u ci ga sa eko ekozhi
And the mountains shall vanish as if they were a mirage,Aciga patizhi to takunzhi laazhe ke rungba nan
 Truly Hell is as a place of ambush,Akika Enan jahannaman kata azaba uyio
 For the transgressors a place of destination,Ya zanazhi e jin lefi Soko kpata na emi lecia ga dano nano
They will dwell therein for ages,Ba gabo aman a fio lokaci nan lokpa sarauyin nan
Nothing cool shall they taste therein nor any drink,A ma awo yeko-yeko ndondoa amaade nuwan fina
Save a boiling fluid and a fluid dark murky intensely cold,Sai de nuwan yipa be nuwan yan etin nae ma-tswan nan
A fitting recompense for them,Egagba nannan wuna jin dai dai be etuna yin naalo yizheo nan
For that they used not to fear any account for their deeds,Akia ajin zanazhie jin kauna egagba wangi ya eti taacina naa
 But they impudently treated Our Signs as false,A maa aya yan Soko zhi yi ganmannan da iyaka
 And all things have We preserved on record,Yandondo ma yi yiu jin lisafi kikaci fi mini takadae bo
So taste ye the fruits of your deeds for no increase shall We grant you except in Punishment,Efe fin azaba Yi yaa be ye yandondoa sai de azaba
Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of the heart´s desires,Akika egagba yan emawo wuna jin tabbata ya zanazhie sundan Soko nan
Gardens enclosed and grapevines,Ganni be yangici lati zhi nanzhi wancin nan be yangici yan inabi
 And voluptuous women of equal age,Ganni be inzagi nazhi yi yezun nan
And a cup full to the brim,Ganni be kopu nazhia she be nuwan managizhi nan
No vanity shall they hear therein nor Untruth-,Amaawo egan banza ko ganmanan mini aljana boa
 Recompense from thy Lord a gift amply sufficient,Egagba nannan zhi eryatwa yan Tsoci wyo uyio
 From the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all between Allah Most Gracious None shall have power to argue with Him,Tsoci wuncin ugae kpa samazhio to kin to yan nazhi dan tsakani a bo nano Etsu yegun uyio efo kiyama ga dabe zandondo kun acin ugan gana
The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand forth in ranks none shall speak except any who is permitted by Allah Most Gracious and He will say what is right,Efo kiyama ga dabe malaika Jibrilu to Malaikazhi kpata aga nakin gi gbaro ade zanaa kpemi gangan naa sai dai be izini yan Etsu yeguny uma gaa gangan gboro wuna gano
That Day will be the sure Reality Therefore whoso will let him take a straight return to his Lord,!Efo wuncin ugayi Efo gaskiya-o zaenindondo nan ula bananu gwausun etun wangizhi ulo lo nko Tsociu
Verily We have warned you of a Penalty near the Day when man will see the deeds which his hands have sent forth and the Unbeliever will say Woe unto me! Would that I were metre dust!,Akika yiya jinye gangba nyan azaba natso-atsoba nan Efo nan zawangia cin le lo yan na egwauzhi la shidzo yau lo Alkiyami na kafiri cia gangan kaasa mi re! Egangan jian na a jin mi yina
By the angels who tear out the souls of the wicked with violence,Sokoe zhi kuti be Malaikauzhi nazhi edza rayi yan kafirizhi be kagbo-enan
By those who gently draw out the souls of the blessed,Soko ezhi kuti be Malaikauzhi nazhi ewa rayi yan muminizhi karayin be yeguninan
And by those who glide along on errands of mercy,Sokoezhi kuti be Malaikauzhi nazhi edin-yin dan lulo etun Sokoo nan
 Then press forward as in a race,Soko ezhi kuti be Malaikazhi nanzhie bichi dan lulo etun-ona Ke eci maci zhi nan
 Then arrange to do the Commands of their Lord,Soko ezhi kuti be Malaikazhi nazhi elayedan alamari Soko dan izheo nan
One Day everything that can be in commotion will be in violent commotion,Efe pa Efona aabe kafo nyan mafari nan
 Followed by oft-repeated commotions,Kafo nyan ba-ci ciabe lamituu nan
 Hearts that Day will be in agitation,Yangban yan kundondo zazhi gaa wodan fowuncin
Cast down will be their owners´ eyes,Fuska nyan kundondo zazhi gaa gbagba fowuncin
They say now What! shall we indeed be returned to our former state,Aciafe gangan beke agayi dan rayi dan da kendoe yiyi pa-yin-na
They say now What! shall we indeed be returned to our former state,Aciafe gangan beke agayi dan rayi dan da kendoe yiyi pa-yin-na
What! - when we shall have become rotten bones,Ba aci na yiazhe tsukun nazhi agiya acia ban nan
They say It would in that case be a return with loss!,Acigan u demaayi acino kundondo zazhi gaajin asara
They say It would in that case be a return with loss!,Acigan u demaayi acino kundondo zazhi gaajin asara
 But verily it will be but a single Compelling Cry,Akika alamari nyan ekin-na efo kiyama ewuti nin kete ungaa kunkeo
When behold they will be in the full awakening to Judgment,Eda-na agae beuna alittazhi kpaata gagunyekan zhi fili ega-gbao
 Has the story of Moses reached thee,Yaa wye Annabi ngba labari yan Annabi Musa be-ebawo ya nin
Behold thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa-,Nyan kakun-na Tsociu yin pati nayi lilici naeyigan tuwa-nao
Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds,Soko cigan yau gan u naukin uloeba firauna ebona firauna a gbin nugun nyan Soko tu
And say to him ´Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified from sin,#NAME?
 ´And that I guide thee to thy Lord so thou shouldst fear Him´,Ebo wyo gaewa min la eko nyan Tsocin wuwye wolaofezanae sundan Soko nan
 Then did Moses show him the Great SignAnnabi Musa Cila aya nawancin-na wu firauna,
Amma Firauna aaya Soko yi ganmanan u ci fe le sokoba loyegboro,
Further he turned his back striving hard against Allah,Ucia Zummazhe cie jin yanna bauna
Then he collected his men and made a proclamation,U cia jamaa zhi kuyekan Zhizhi uci ya mi yaa
Saying I am your Lord Most High,Uci fe-gan gan mi Firauna gayi tsoci ye natso latu gan nan-o
But Allah did punish him and made an example of him - in the Hereafter as in this life,Soko ciu wan ebo lefi natso-u jin zunma-o na to yan mafari na-ujin nan
 Verily in this is an instructive warning for whosoever feareth Allah,Akikawuncin-naajin be firauna nan uga afe gan-gba ya zanazhi gae-sudan Soko nan
 What! Are ye the more difficult to create or the heaven above Allah hath constructed it,Yegayi alita natso gboka gan-nao Kashi sanma Gutwaba nayi tu gikin-ni bekagbo enan
 On high hath He raised its canopy and He hath given it order and perfection,Soko cia sama latu uci kezhiu jin daidai
Its night doth He endow with darkness and its splendour doth He bring out with light,Soko cia Yeshiu laa shi Zhiko ucia yigidiu laana-behaske
 And the earth moreover hath He extended to a wide expanse,Baaci wuncino ucia ta cici paarae
He draweth out therefrom its moisture and its pasture,Ucia nuwan ladzunzhin dagan mini-u-bo gangani be yangici nyan dabbazhi
And the mountains hath He firmly fixed-,Soko ma kezhea patizhi kan gikinbo be kagboe
For use and convenience to you and your cattle,Kpata Yannazhi ebo alaafe eyan emawoa yayezawangizhi to dabba yezhi
 Therefore when there comes the great overwhelming Event-,Ammade Efona ebazhe wanciko nyan kiyama gabe dabe nan
 The Day when man shall remember all that he strove for,Efo wuncin Zawangi-ndondo wun apa iri etun nazhi u lo izhe-o-nana
 And Hell-Fire shall be placed in full view for all to see-,Aciga ena nyan jahimi laakefili yazanazhi ga-- yin a liuye nan
Then for such as had transgressed all bounds,Akika Zandondo nagaafe zanaegbin iyaka Soko tunan
And had preferred the life of this world,Uci Kezhiea cincin nyan-izhe laagboka dan yangbanubo a gan yan alkiyami na
 The Abode will be Hell-Fire,Akika ena nyan jahimu gaayi ezhe-keba-wun-o
 And for such as had entertained the fear of standing before their Lord´s tribunal and had restrained their soul from lower desires,Ammade Zandondo nagaafe zanaesundan kinigi yegboro yan Tsoci-u- bonan ucia eyan shahawa yizhe laakan yangbanu na
 Their abode will be the Garden,Akika Aljanna-gaayi ezhe keba wun-o
They ask thee about the Hour-´When will be its appointed time,Kafirizhi Aajin afe gbinwyogan-ganFociotsa ajin Kiyama-o
 Wherein art thou concerned with the declaration thereof,Kinigiba kici wyoga akpe akika yan efo kiyama yeo
 With thy Lord in the Limit fixed therefor,Kpikpe yan alamari Kiyama Kpata dan-be Sokoe
Thou art but a Warner for such as fear it,Etun yan-wyo-de wyojin gangaoya zanazhi gae sundan efo kiyama-nan
 The Day they see it It will be as if they had tarried but a single evening or at most till the following morn!,Fondondo nan aga efo kiyama leyena zandondo-afe leye ke edunfe wyin kabario uyi daidai be lokaci yeshi nini-nan ko ke lokaci yan wallae na
They ask thee concerning things taken as spoils of war Say such spoils are at the disposal of Allah and the Messenger So fear Allah and keep straight the relations between yourselves Obey Allah and His Messenger if ye do believe,Egbin wyogan eti hukunci yan Ganiimao Gangan- Ganiima naagade kunda yanmusuluncio na yan Soko uyio Toci ebo acino esundan Soko ye mae fe jin gyara tsakani ebo be dozhi yemae fe gba Soko to Tuciu wunayi muminizhiye yiona
 For Believers are those who when Allah is mentioned feel a tremor in their hearts and when they hear His signs rehearsed find their faith strengthened and put all their trust in their Lord,Hakika de zanazhie ye muminizhia agayi zanazhi kandondo na aga sunna Soko tunye yangbanazhie lashe be dansun Sokoe nao ama ga aya Soko zhigba yaa wunajin ubea imani jin be Sokoe Tsociama wyun gae yakpe dan hali ndondo bo
 For Believers are those who when Allah is mentioned feel a tremor in their hearts and when they hear His signs rehearsed find their faith strengthened and put all their trust in their Lord,Hakika de zanazhie ye muminizhia agayi zanazhi kandondo na aga sunna Soko tunye yangbanazhie lashe be dansun Sokoe nao ama ga aya Soko zhigba yaa wunajin ubea imani jin be Sokoe Tsociama wyun gae yakpe dan hali ndondo bo
Who establish regular prayers and spend freely out of the gifts We have given them for sustenance,Zanazhie ku sallah gikini na amaajin afe wu dukiyaazhi mini arziki nazhi Yi la yaa na fi eko Sokoo
Such in truth are the believers they have grades of dignity with their Lord and forgiveness and generous sustenance,Za wuncinzhi agayi muminizhi yan gaskiyao Ayi be daraja kozhi dan eba Tsociabo to gafara na Wyunajinana to arziki na wancin na
 Such in truth are the believers they have grades of dignity with their Lord and forgiveness and generous sustenance,Za wuncinzhi agayi muminizhi yan gaskiyao Ayi be daraja kozhi dan eba Tsociabo to gafara na Wyunajinana to arziki na wancin na
 Just as thy Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth even though a party among the Believers disliked it,Kendoe Tsoci wyoe la wyo tinya dagan emi wyobo be gaskiyae na hakika Sashi Mini muminizhio ajin afe navonaatinya nbo ebo Sokoo na
 Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest as if they were being driven to death and they actually saw it,Acia jin afe gbomi bewyoyin dan mini alamari gaskiyaa latuani na acie jin bojin ke wyoa gangan edaagwa da lo eba ajali na alaalima amaeleu ye
 Behold! Allah promised you one of the two enemy parties that it should be yours Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours but Allah willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers-,To kamina Soko jin ye alkawali yan nasara ta etijamaa ninio mini jamaa gubabao nao kede Wyunga ye laataatio na ye cie kpaye gan jama nazhi de eyan kunana aga Sokoa la yaye yeo na Soko maakpa shizo gan wyunga gaskiyalaajin tabbata be hukunci uyin Umau la edzo yan kafirizhiu dzau ya
 That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false distasteful though it be to those in guilt,Ebo ula gaskiyau laujin tabbata Umaula ganmanau nyinu ya kadalefi jincizhi ga navo na
Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord and He answered you I will assist you with a thousand of the angels ranks on ranks,Yepa Kamina ye fe ba taimako dagan eba Tsoci yebo na Umacia aduwa ye gwo kede - hakika mia jin ye taimako be malaika kpuutsuny nazhia lami latu dozhi na
Allah made it but a message of hope and an assurance to your hearts in any case there is no help except from Allah and Allah is Exalted in Power Wise,Soko ma la wuncin la fea saide yangbanfa alheri ebo ma to yangban yezhi alaashi tsuuyin beu yin ye mae kpeewo kede nasara udan be zando yina sai be Sokoe na  Hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyioEtsu hikima uyio
 Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness to give you calm as from Himself and he caused rain to descend on you from heaven to clean you therewith to remove from you the stain of Satan to strengthen your hearts and to plant your feet firmly therewith,Epa Kamina Soko la yi-gbe ta cia laakpe ye na Ucia fe aminci yaye dagan eba ubo Uci fe du ele be yaye dagan sanmao ebo ula ye yeu li beu yin Umaula shikan yan shetan yanu kpeu ya be yin ebo ma ula yan gban yezhiu wanu pa be kagbo imani umau la bici kinpa yezhiu g okau ta eti kinbo
Remember thy Lord inspired the angels with the message I am with you give firmness to the Believers I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them,Kamina Tsoci wyoe fe jin wahayi fi Malaikazhi na kede Hakika mi dan be ye yin ebo acino egbo yangban yan muminizhi ka be imani bele yin yin Miga edo be dansuni ce dan yangban yan za nazhia jin kafirinci nao ebo acino ewua eti koroazhio ye mae wua vundunugiazhio
This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger If any contend against Allah and His Messenger Allah is strict in punishment,Wuncin mayi ebo na a le Soko be Tuciu yin ba nao Zan dondo na ma gae le Soko be Tuciu yin ba na to hakika Soko gbota eba azaba jino
Thus will it be said Taste ye then of the punishment for those who resist Allah is the penalty of the Fire,Wuncin zhi ga dano nao efe fin azaba Soko hakika ma azaba yan ena ugaajin tabbata ya kafirizhi
O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array never turn your backs to them,Ya yenazhia imani jin na! kandondo na ye gagun be kafirizhi ekundao na to ega kara zhe zunmayezhi yaa ma
If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war or to retreat to a troop of his own- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah and his abode is Hell- an evil refuge indeed!,Zandondo na ga zunmauzhe cie bici efo iri wuncinina sai de wyo gae wa gan wyoa ye enasa ya ekungun na koma wyoa zheban da tsun ekun gunci nayncin wyozhi na ka gan ujin be uzuri yina to zawuncina zheban zhe be ewunzhe dagan eba Soko ezhekebau mayi ena jahanna ma bibi majin tabbata ya zoba wuncin
It is not ye who slew them it was Allah when thou threwest a handful of dust it was not thy act but Allah´s in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth all things,Uma jin ye wu a ammade Soko wuaoumaji wyo ce yan kea kamina wyo ce yan naa Ammade Soko ce yano Ebo ma Wyunuma Muminizhiu cinule be mima cin le wangiI dagan eba uboHakika Soko Etsu nae wo na uyioEtsu kpikpe uyioSurah That and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the UnbelieversWuncinzhi ga dano nao hakika ma Soko ga tanadi yan kafirizhi to gbogun
 O Unbelievers! if ye prayed for victory and judgment now hath the judgment come to you if ye desist from wrong it will be best for you if ye return to the attack so shall We Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied for verily Allah is with those who believe!,Wunayi gan nassara yee wao to nassara dabe yaye yeani ye ma ga etun dede lugwa to wuncin gayi alheri ya yeo ye ma ga ke dazhin eti ewun sunoyi tso maake dazhin be azabze jamaa nazhi ma ye aga dokun ganacin Hakika ma Soko dan be Muminizhi
 O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger and turn not away from him when ye hear him speakYa ye nazhia imani jin na yea gba Soko to Tuciu ye mae ga zhe zunma ta alamari Soko ma alaali ma ye tsoe wo na wyune yie na,
 Nor be like those who say We hear but listen not,Ye mae gaa fe iri yan zanazhi ganganyi wo alaalima ewoa na ma
 For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb- those who understand not,Hakika dabba na biyegan mini dabbazhi eba Sokoo na agayi zanazhia te tukpa ewogan Sokoa acie zhe edingizhi amaafe zanazhie lotun be hankalia yina na
 If Allah had found in them any good He would indeed have made them listen As it is if He had made them listen they would but have turned back and declined Faith,Soko ga tsun alheri tsun fi bea yin da wyuna yaa iko yan wiwo ama jin eza alheri zhia kaUga yaa iiko wiwo hakika aga zunmazheta gaskiya aci ga keu lugwa
 O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His Messenger when He calleth you to that which will give you life and know that Allah cometh in between a man and his heart and that it is He to Whom ye shall all be gathered,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Efe ye yiyi Soko be yan Tuciy kandondo na uga yie lo eba yan naa be rayi be rayuwa wangi naYe mae kpe wo kede Soko wyunajinulo dan tsakani zawangi be yan nazhigae sa fi yangbanuna be ajalii hakika ma Etsu uyio na ga ye kpata kuyekan zhiyegboroubo na
And fear tumult or oppression which affecteth not in particular only those of you who do wrong and know that Allah is strict in punishment,Ye mae tswa fitina na masiibau wuna kan eti azwalumi nazhi dinu be kawan yina na ye mae kpee wo kede hakika Soko Etsu na gbota eba jinjin azaba bona uyio
Call to mind when ye were a small band despised through the land and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you But He provided a safe asylum for you strengthened you with His aid and gave you Good things for sustenance that ye might be grateful,Ye mae pa lokacina yea fe ezadegi namaafe eza gbogunnzhi fi kinbo na ye ci fe sundan na zandoncizhia bea ye fe la na Soko cia ye ya ecinba yan yangbanshi madinao Ucia ye ya kagbo be nasara uyin uci kezhea ye ya arziki dagan mini yangici wangizhio ebo ujinwo be wuncinzhi ye gaafe za nazhie jin yebo ya Soko na
O ye that believe! betray not the trust of Allah and the Messenger nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! E ga fe ta Soko to Tuciu be jinjin hainciima ye tso mae ga jin dozhi haincife gi amana dozhi maalaali ma yetso kpewo ke ugyea na
 And know ye that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial and that it is Allah with Whom lies your highest reward,Ye mae kpe kede hakika dukiya yezhi to egi yezhi fitina ayio na hakika ma zana ga tswa Soko danbo na egagba na wancin na gaajin tabatta yau dan eba Soko
 O ye who believe! if ye fear Allah He will grant you a criterion to judge between right and wrong remove from you all evil that may afflict you and forgive you for Allah is the Lord of grace unboundedYa ye nazhia imani jin na! ,Ye gaafe za nazhie tswa Soko cie sundan una uga etsazhi be erikpe wangizhi laaya ye uma ga etun dede yezhi kpata paya ya ye umaafe be yin Soko ma Etsu falala uyio na wancin na
Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee to keep thee in bonds or slay thee or get thee out of thy home They plot and plan and Allah too plans but the best of planners is Allah,Wyo mao pa lokaci na zanazhia jin kafirinci na fe pa makirinci eti wyobo na ebo ala wyoa kanadan koma ala wyo yaa wu koma ala wyo yaa nyan adzun ezhio na Acie dinyin fe jin makirinci Soko otso mae woa gbata be makirincia yin Soko ma ta eti zanazhie jin makirinci kpata na
Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee to keep thee in bonds or slay thee or get thee out of thy home They plot and plan and Allah too plans but the best of planners is Allah,Wyo mao pa lokaci na zanazhia jin kafirinci na fe pa makirinci eti wyobo na ebo ala wyoa kanadan koma ala wyo yaa wu koma ala wyo yaa nyan adzun ezhio na Acie dinyin fe jin makirinci Soko otso mae woa gbata be makirincia yin Soko ma ta eti zanazhie jin makirinci kpata na
 When Our Signs are rehearsed to them they say We have heard this before if we wished we could say words like these these are nothing but tales of the ancientsAma ga gba aya Yizhi yaa ajin agangan ,Hakika yiwo nana leani uga bayi tso da yitso agan iri nana ma nana deufea saide ecin yan zamafarizhi
Remember how they said O Allah if this is indeed the Truth from Thee rain down on us a shower of stones form the sky or send us a grievous penalty,To kamina agan gan ya wyoe Soko! Wunayi gan alamari nana wyun gayi gaskiya na fe be dagan eba wyobo nao to dule yan takun azaba be kpeyi dagan sanmao koma wyoobeo yayi be azaba ndoci na tan na
But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon,Soko mafe Etsu na ajina azaba naa alalima wyo yidan taacinabo naa Soko mafe Etsu naajina azaba naa alalima afe zanazhie ba gafara naa
 But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them when they keep out men from the sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians No men can be its guardians except the righteous but most of them do not understand,Kima dan bea yino naala Soko cia jinazaba naa yino alaalima ekan zawangizhi ke masalaci Harami lugwa nao Uma jin atsawun hak yan tswi tswa wuna Hakika zanazhi wun hakika yan tswi tswauna aga yi zanazhi gae tswa Soko acie sundanUnao Ammade ekun dondo azhi ade kpikpea
Their prayer at the House of Allah is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands Its only answer can be Taste ye the penalty because ye blasphemed,Sallaazhi ma eba kata kaabao ufea sai de iko-be be egwa-koe eboacino efe fin azaba ebo iri etun kafirinci nazhi ye fe lo na
The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder man from the path of Allah and so will they continue to spend but in the end they will have only regrets and sighs at length they will be overcome and the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell-,Hakika zanazhia jin kafirinci be Sokoe na ajin afe wu dukiya azhi ebo adebaakan zawangi zhi ezan ta eti ekpa Soko to aga dukiyazhi wugagancin uci gaafe ro-- n kpe yaa gancin be acigaa zankpe zanazhi maajin kafirinci na a kuaku yekan lo ena jahanama
 In order that Allah may separate the impure from the pure put the impure one on another heap them together and cast them into Hell They will be the ones to have lost,Ebo Soko debau la eyan dedezhiu tsau ya dagan mini eyan wangi zhio Uciu la eyan dedezhiu kuukpe eti sashio uci gau laafe dan mini ena jahanamao Zawun ci zhi aga yi eza hassarazhio
Say to the Unbelievers if now they desist from Unbelief their past would be forgiven them but if they persist the punishment of those before them is already a matter of warning for them,Gan ya zanazhia jin kafirinci na aga gwa kpe eti yan na Sokoa kan na aafa beayin yan yannazhi ajin shidzo na hakika ekpa hallaka yan za mafari zhi wuna shidzoa ni
And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere but if they cease verily Allah doth see all that they do,Ye mae gunakun har fitina ndondo uga ke ma gancin adini jin baenio ulauzhe ebo Soko ya Soko gbuugi To aga bea egwa kpebo to hakika Sokoe cinale be iri etun nazhi elo na
 If they refuse be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help,Ama ga zunma zheta to ye kpe wo danona kede hakika Soko gayi Ndakata ye yeona Madanla be Etsu na yi Ndakatana Madanla be Etsu taimakoe
And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire in war a fifth share is assigned to Allah- and to the Messenger and to near relatives orphans the needy and the wayfarer- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing- the Day of the meeting of the two forces For Allah hath power over all things,Ye mae kpe wo kede yan dondo na ye gade yan ganima na to Soko ga wun nini yan gutsun wuno to yan Tuci to eza tsonbazhi to ekungizhi to eza gwa gbagizhi ye gaafe gan yea imani jin be Sokoe be yanna yi cin be ya wuzhi Yi MUHAMMADUefo ekun-erikpe na efo na jamaa guba da gun dozhi na Soko ma Etsu iko uyio ta eti yandondo
Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley and they on the farther side and the caravan on lower ground than ye Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet ye would certainly have failed in the appointment But thus ye met that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted that those who died might die after a clear Sign had been given and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign had been given And verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth all things,Ye mae pa kamina yedan kansanta natso tsoba na ama dan kansata natsoa kpe ya na gancin kodagbaazhi ma afe kpankpanyin be eba ye aci dan tako yebo Kada ye ga jin dozhi alkawali jin eti ezan aningao da yega ce leba dozhi eba lokaci alkawalio Ammaa Sokou laafe aninga ebo ula hukunciu ba eti alamari ndoci na wyune wa gan ulaaufe na Ebo ma zana gajin hallaka na unjin hallaka eti bayanio Umaula zanaUgaa dan rayi naU dan rayi be dalili Hakika ma Soko Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio
 Remember in thy dream Allah showed them to thee as few if He had shown them to thee as many ye would surely have been discouraged and ye would surely have disputed in your decision but Allah saved you for He knoweth well the secrets of all hearts,Wyo mao pa kamina Soko fe laa wu wye dan mini eleo ke jamaa degi ayio na daaci gan ulaa lawu wye kendoe adokun na da ye gaa wo dansun ye gaa to gbogun ye maafe gbomi be dozhi eti alamari wuncino ammaade Sokoa egwa kan Hakika wyin Soko Uyi be kpikpe yan yannazhi fi yangban zawangizhio na
And remember when ye met He showed them to you as few in your eyes and He made you appear as contemptible in their eyes that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted For to Allah do all questions go back for decision,Epa kamina ufe laa wu ye na kamina ye bea gun be dozhi na eye yebo afe eza de gi umaa yetso lafe eza degi dan eyeabo ebo Sokoula hukunciuba eti alamari ndoci na ga fe na Alamari kpata ma eba Soko ga a kezhe loo
O ye who believe! When ye meet a force be firm and call Allah in remembrance much and often that ye may prosper,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ye ga bea gun gun be jama ndocizhi eti ekuno to yea kpe gikini Ye mae fe tun Sokoe ye sarauyin ujin wo be wuncin yega tso guri
And obey Allah and His Messenger and fall into no disputes lest ye lose heart and your power depart and be patient and persevering For Allah is with those who patiently persevere,Ye mae la mie tu Soko be Tuciu yin ye mae ga gbomi yan cen leba be dozhi ma kacina ye ga to gbogun gancin kagboe ma gaa gan be yin ye mae la hakurie jin Hakika Soko ajin udan be zanazhi gae jin hakuri nae
And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seen of men and to hinder men from the path of Allah For Allah compasseth round about all that they do,Ye mae gaafe ke dozhin zanazhi tinya eti fahri jino be ebo zawangizhia leaye na ma acie kan zawangizhi ezanda ta eti ekpa Soko Soko maa etun nazhie lo kpatana makezhe
Remember Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them and said No one among men can overcome you this day while I am near to you But when the two forces came in sight of each other he turned on his heels and said Lo! I am clear of you lo! I see what ye see not Lo! I fear Allah for Allah is strict in punishment,To kamina shaitan yina etun dedeazhi laa pa nin fia na Uci gan zandondo danbo mini zawangizhio naa zan yekpe na mi ma dan be ye yin kpan-yin Gancin kamina jamaa guba ba bea gunbe dozhi na shaitan cidauda zunma Uci gan Hakika mia egwa mi wa be ye yin! mi mae le yannazhi ye le yea na ye mi mae sundan Soko Soko ma Etsu uyio na gbota azaba jinona
 Lo! the hypocrites say and those in whose hearts is a disease These people- their religion has misled them But if any trust in Allah behold! Allah is Exalted in might Wise,To lokaci na munafukzhi to zanazhi batan dan yangbanabo na fe gangan gan  Adini yan za nanazhi wuna ta fi egbino zaeni ndondo na gaa yakpe Soko na to hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
If thou couldst see when the angels take the souls of the Unbelievers at death How they smite their faces and their backs saying Taste the penalty of the blazing Fire-,Be ma da aci gan wyo le ye lokaci na malaikazhi gae gwo rayi yan za nazhi ajin kafirinci na malaikazhie ciafe wua fuskaazhio to zunmaazhioacia fe ganagan E fe fin azaba yan ena kikeci
Because of the deeds which your own hands sent forth for Allah is never unjust to His servants,Wuncin mayi ebo iri etun dede na egwa yetsozhi lashidzo yenao hakika ma Soko ujin Etsu azwalumi lo eba wuzhi ndondoa
Deeds after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them They rejected the Signs of Allah and Allah punished them for their crimes for Allah is Strong and Strict in punishment,Kendoe alada yan jamaa yan firauna be zanazhi shiadzo na ajin kafirinci be aya Soko zhi Soko cia wan be lefiazhi hakika Soko Etsu kagbo uyio Etsu na ma gbota eba azaba jino na uyio
 Because Allah will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their own souls and verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth all things,Wuncin ma afe ebona hakika Soko ufe Etsu naela egbazhe de de dan mini niima na uga la ya jamaa ndoci eti Emano naa sai de atso ga egbazhe de de laadan yangbanazhio Hakika Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio
 Deeds after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them They treated as false the Signs of their Lord so We destroyed them for their crimes and We drowned the people of Pharaoh for they were all oppressors and wrong-doers,Kenadoe alada yan jamaa yan firaunazhi yi na to zanazhi shia dzo na to Yi cia jin hallaka be zunubia zhi yi cia jamaa yan firauna zhi gbin fi nuwan eduo kpataama afe azwalumizhi
 For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him They will not believe,Hakika dabba na biye uma wuye gan mini dabbazhio na eba Sokoona aga yi zanazhi-ajin kafirinci aci ye gan ajin imanianao
 They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant but they break their covenant every time and they have not the fear of Allah,Zanazhi wyo pa alkawali be yin miniabo na gancin acia jin afe lo alkawali ya kandondo na amaafe za nazhie tswa Sokoa amae sundan wyuna na
If ye gain the mastery over them in war disperse with them those who follow them that they may remember,To wyo ga bea tswo gwa mini ekuno aala fe misali ya zazumaaazhi ebo alaabici ujin wo be wunciny uga afe sin san tu yaa
If thou fearest treachery from any group throw back their covenant to them so as to be on equal terms for Allah loveth not the treacherous,Wyo ma gae be sundan yan TITA hainci dagan gwata jamaa ndoci zhio to a alkawalia ceya yaa kendoe atso jin na hakika Sokoe wa zanazhi gae jin hainci naa
Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better of the godly they will never frustrate them,Zanazhi maajin kafirnci na aga fe kpa ye gan ayea gan gwa ma hakika a gangwaa
Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power including steeds of war to strike terror into the hearts of the enemies of Allah and your enemies and others besides whom ye may not know but whom Allah doth know Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of Allah shall be repaid unto you and ye shall not be treated unjustly,Ye mae dan shiri boe kaa be gwargwado yan yanna ye ga de kagbou yan kagbo na to doko yan ekun zhina ebo ye lae li makiyi Soko zhi dan to makiyi ye tso zhi to ndoci zhi nazhi jin ayeana ye kpea yea Soko de kpea ye yan dondo na ma ye ga wu fi eko Soko-ona Soko gaa egagba alheri shekpan ya ye ye maade zanaajin ye zwalunci naa
But if the enemy incline towards peace do thou also incline towards peace and trust in Allah for He is One that heareth and knoweth all things,Ama gaya kasan lo wi wa yan edun fe lafiya be ye yin to wyotso-oya kasanolo wuncin wyomao lao yao kpe Soko Hakika wyun ga yi Etsu na ma yi be kpi kpe yandondo nao Etsu na ma yi be kpikpe yandondoe na
 Should they intend to deceive thee- verily Allah sufficeth thee He it is That hath strengthened thee with His aid and with the company of the Believers,Ama gaakpa gan ata wyoe to hakika Soko tsakun ke ya wyo-yao wyun ga yi Etsu na gbo wyo ka be taimakou yin nao to be muminizhi nao
And moreover He hath put affection between their hearts not if thou hadst spent all that is in the earth couldst thou have produced that affection but Allah hath done it for He is Exalted in might Wise,Ucia cin cin laadan tsakani yangbanazhio be dozhi kada wyo ga yannazhifi kin bo kpatana wu yaa wyo la cincin dan tsakani yangba yangbanazhio woa ammaade Sokoa cincin laadan tsakaniabo Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima ma uyio
 O Prophet! sufficient unto thee is Allah- unto thee and unto those who follow thee among the Believers,Ya wyoe Annabi! Sokoa kunke ya wyo yaani to zanazhi ga mi tu wyoe mini muminizhio na
 O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight If there are twenty amongst you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred if a hundred they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers for these are a people without understanding,Ya wyoe Annabi! A evunba yan ekun laalo dan yangban yan muminizhio a ga de eza shi mini yebo nazhia hankuri jin na agaade zankpe galaba ta eti eza kpakoa ama ga de eza shitsun mini yebo agaa de zankpe ta eti za kpuu tsuno mini zanazhia jin kafirinci nao ebo na aezazhia ayio na egane ye ana
 O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight If there are twenty amongst you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred if a hundred they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers for these are a people without understanding,Ya wyoe Annabi! A evunba yan ekun laalo dan yangban yan muminizhio a ga de eza shi mini yebo nazhia hankuri jin na agaade zankpe galaba ta eti eza kpakoa ama ga de eza shitsun mini yebo agaa de zankpe ta eti za kpuu tsuno mini zanazhia jin kafirinci nao ebo na aezazhia ayio na egane ye ana
 For the present Allah hath lightened your task for He knoweth that there is a weak spot in you But even so if there are a hundred of you patient and persevering they will vanquish two hundred and if a thousand they will vanquish two thousand with the leave of Allah for Allah is with those who patiently persevere,Gbani Sokoa sauki jin ya ye uma kpe-wo ke gbogun to wuna lo ye na Eboacino aga de eza shitsun na de hankurina dan mini ye bo agadegalaba zankpe ta eti za kpako ama ga de za kpuutsun mini ye bo agaade zankpeta eti za kpuutsun gubae be izini Sokoe Soko mae dan be zanazhi gae jin hankuri nae
It is not fitting for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land Ye look for the temporal goods of this world but Allah looketh to the Hereafter And Allah is Exalted in might Wise,Ugwoyin ya Annabi ndondo na wyunade wuzhi zhi yan ekun naa sai de uga gun kun ucia de zankpe ta eti kinbo Ye ye kpa dide yan eyan zwoci yan izhe zhi Soko ma Etsu zan kpe uyio Etsu hikima ma uyio
 Had it not been for a previous ordainment from Allah a severe penalty would have reached you for the ransom that ye took,Kagan ujin ebo hukunci Sokonaashidzo dan litafio naa daa azaba na gbota na gae de ebo yannazhi yegwo eti sisaabo na
But now enjoy what ye took in war lawful and good but fear Allah for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Eboacino egi mini ganima nazhi yega de ekun dao uci yi halali umayi wangi na Ye mae tswa Soko be edansun uyin hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu ye gun uyio
But now enjoy what ye took in war lawful and good but fear Allah for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Eboacino egi mini ganima nazhi yega de ekun dao uci yi halali umayi wangi na Ye mae tswa Soko be edansun uyin hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu ye gun uyio
 O Prophet! say to those who are captives in your hands If Allah findeth any good in your hearts He will give you something better than what has been taken from you and He will forgive you for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most MercifulYa wyoe Annabi! Gan ya za nazhi fi gwa ye bo ama yi za win wan ci zhi na Soko ga tsun alheri fi mini yangban ye zhio wyuna yae alheri natso gan yanna agwo be ye yin nae umaajine gafara Soko ma Etsu ye gun uyio,
But if they have treacherous designs against thee O Messenger! they have already been in treason against Allah and so hath He given thee power over them And Allah so He Who hath full knowledge and wisdom,Ama gae kpa gan ajin wyoe haainci hakika ajin to Sokootso hainci leani Soko cia wyo ya kagbo ta eti abo Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
 Those who believed and adopted exile and fought for the Faith with their property and their persons in the cause of Allah as well as those who gave them asylum and aid- these are all friends and protectors one of another As to those who believed but came not into exile ye owe no duty of protection to them until they come into exile but if they seek your aid in religion it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom ye have a treaty of mutual alliance And remember Allah seeth all that ye do,Hakika zanazhia imani jin na aci kezhea kpe la ke eyan de de lugwa na aci jin jiadi kokari be dukiyaazhi to zanazhi twarya yan ecinbazhi na aci ke zhe jin taimako na za wuncin zhi maso yi zhi ayio ya dozhi Zanazhi maa imani jin na ama kpe laa na ye de yandoci naabo ye keba be dozhi naa sai kamina agaa kpela na Ama ga wa taimako be ye yin mini adinio ejina taimako sai de ugaazhe eti zandoci nazhi alkawali ndoci dan tsakani yebo bea yin na Soko mae cin ye cin le be iri etun nazhi ye lo na
The Unbelievers are protectors one of another Unless ye do this protect each other there would be tumult and oppression on earth and great mischief,Zanazhi maajin kafirinci na sashiazhi masoyi saashizhi ayio kagan ye jin acina yeci wa dozhia fitina ndoci gaajin tabatta dan kinbo gan-ni be eyan nyin na wancin nae
 Those who believe and adopt exile and fight for the Faith in the cause of Allah as well as those who give them asylum and aid- these are all in very truth the Believers for them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision most generous,Zanazhi maa imani jin na acia kpela na aci jin jihadi kokari ta eti ekpa Soko ona to zanazhi twarya ecinbazhi ya muhajiruzhi na ama kezhe jin taimako na to za wuncinzhi gayi mumini yan gaskiya zhio gafara gajin tabbata yaa to arziki na wancin na
And those who accept Faith subsequently and adopt exile and fight for the Faith in your company- they are of you But kindred by blood have prior rights against each other in the Book of Allah Verily Allah is well-acquainted with all things,Zanazhi ma ga imani jin dagan zumao na acia kpe la aci kezhe jin jihadi kokari keba be yeyin na to za wuncinzhi gayi zaba yezhio Dangizhi-ma sashizhi tsoba dozhi gan sashi dan mini litafi Soko Hakika Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yandondo
The Prophet frowned and turned away,Annabi Muhammadu Wuna eyeu fin uci kezhea zunman zheta
 Because there came to him the blind man interrupting,Ebona Yebonci dade-ebaunan
But what could tell thee but that perchance he might grow in spiritual understanding-,Annabi Wyo kpe-ko u-be-be ebo u-biu de lili yan ibadau
Or that he might receive admonition and the teaching might profit him,Ko-ma wun-a shitukpa ya tukpapa natso ajinu anfaninan
As to one who regards Himself as self-sufficient,Zanazhi-ewo kunkunke nyan-tita acin ana
To him dost thou attend,Zawuncinzhi ga wyoe shitukpa yao
 Though it is no blame to thee if he grow not in spiritual understanding,Kinci to wyo bo Kagan uli etitacinu be bawu Nyan Alkuranu yan yananao
 But as to him who came to thee striving earnestly,Eza-na-ma be ba wye be yangban wangi cie-wa ekoke nan
And with fear in his heart,Umayi Eza dansun Soko nan
Of him wast thou unmindful,Wyocin dzun ganu-bo wyo shitukpa ya wuna
By no means should it be so! For it is indeed a Message of instruction,Aa akika Alkuranu Tukpapa Tsau yio
 Therefore let whoso will keep it in remembrance,Zana ugabe-bana u la egwau-sun umanujin beu-yin
It is in Books held greatly in honour,Tukpapa-nanma fi mini litafi nayi cin-wacinao
 Exalted in dignity kept pure and holy,Litafi Na Latuna u mayi lilic-nan
Written by the hands of scribes-,Alkuranu na sun gwa malaika Lilici zhio nan

All these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands,Kpata zanazhia tunye daana agbin iyaka Soko tu dan kinmiazhio
And heaped therein mischief on mischief,Ama fe nyi yanzhi sarauyin fi kinbo
Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements,Soko ci cin azaba yan hallaka na tan sarauyin na be yaa kpaata
 For thy Lord is as a Guardian on a watch-tower,Akika Sokoe cin yana zandondoe jin na le
Now as for man when his Lord trieth him giving him honour and gifts then saith he puffed up My Lord hath honoured me,Udan mini tabia dede yan zawangio kami ndondo na Soko gau macinle be eryatwa yan cinwan ko be arziki yan emawo yizhe na wuna fe pe u fe leye gan kagbou tsayi yana din arziki wuncin be ya wuno nan

 And thy Lord cometh and His angels rank upon rank,Kanga malaikazhi ci gaa dzunzhin be foro Sokoe aciga ta safu-safu

 A declaration of immunity from Allah and His Messenger to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances-,Egwa-wa danna dagan eba Soko to Tuciu lo eba zanazhi ye jin alkawali beyin mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci nao
Go ye then for four months backwards and forwards as ye will throughout the land but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah by your falsehood but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him,Ebo acino efe dazan kpe eti kinbo har etswa gunni kafa uyio na Soko ya kafirizhi na ye mae kpe-ewo kede ye yegan Soko gwa woa na hakika ma Soko ga kafirizhi sunzunye
f the Great Pilgrimage- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve treaty obligations with the Pagans If then ye repent it were best for you but if ye turn away know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith,Emi-ya ma danna dagan eba Soko to Tuciuyin lo eba zawangizhi efo haji wanciko kede hakika Soko to Tuciu agwaa wa be zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci nae Ebo acino ye ga tuba jin to wuncinafe alheri yae gan ye ma ga zunma zheta to yekpe-ewo kede hakika ye gan Soko gwaa na wyo mao ya zanazhia jin kafirinci na labari yan azaba na yi tintanci na
 But the treaties are not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught nor aided any one against you So fulfil your engagements with them to the end of their term for Allah loveth the righteous,Sai de zanazhi ye ga jin alkawali be yin mini zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci gancin ma ake ye yandondoa na amajin zandondo taimako be gunye kunana to yea alkawaliazhi she yahar da lokaci na yega jin yeda bedozhina Hakika Soko wyune wa zanazhi gaetswa Soko cie sundanuna
But when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them an seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity then open the way for them for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Gancin-ma etswa yan alfurma zhi gaa gwo gan to egun mushirikizhi kun bandondo na ye ga tswoa gwa-na ye mae laae wan ye mae laae kanedan ye mae tsoe kaa ecinba ndondo Gancin aga bea tuba jin acia sallah ku gikini acia zakka dukiyaazhi wa to yea ekoa ya yaa Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun ma uyio
If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum grant it to him so that he may hear the word of Allah and then escort him to where he can be secure That is because they are men without knowledge,Za eni ndondo mini mushirikizhio na ga wa tsonba wyoe ebo tswitswaona egwou tswa har u-wo egan Soko gancin ye cie la wyunelobana ugade aminci na wuncin mayi ebo na afe jamaa nazhi de kpikpea na
How can there be a league before Allah and His Messenger with the Pagans except those with whom ye made a treaty near the sacred Mosque As long as these stand true to you stand ye true to them for Allah doth love the righteous,Ke wuna yi yi mushirikizhi cia de alkawali ndoci dan be Sokoe to be Tuciu yin nao Sai de nazhi ye ga jin alkawali be yin eba massalaci haramio na To atso gaa da gboro be ye yin to yetso a da b-- ro bea yin Hakika Sokoe wa zanazhi gae tswau acie sundanu na
 How can there be such a league seeing that if they get an advantage over you they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant With fair words from their mouths they entice you but their hearts are averse from you and most of them are rebellious and wicked,Keu yi yi nao alalima agaade zankpe ta eti yebo aatswa zumunci ndondo ko amana be yina yino Adeajin afe jin yeda be ye yin yan misunazhi yangbanazhi mae navo Ekun-dondo ma fasikizhi ayio
 The Signs of Allah have they sold for a miserable price and many have they hindered from His way evil indeed are the deeds they have done,A aya Soko zhi laashi ewo-izhe na yi te ten gi na gancin acie kan zawangi zhi ezan ta eti ekpa Soko Hakika zawuncin zhi etun nae lo na a biye
In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who have transgressed all boundsE tswa zumun ci ndondo ya muminia baleotso acia gangan alkawalia zawuncin zhi ma aga yi zanazhie gbin iya ka tu nao,
 But even so if they repent establish regular prayers and practise regular charity- they are your brethren in Faith thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who understand,To aga bea tuba jin acia sallah ku gikini acia zakka dukiyaazhi wa to azhe yegi yezhiani danona mini adinio Yi mae kpe ayazhi ye ka ka yin ya zanazhi ga de kpikpe na
 But even so if they repent establish regular prayers and practise regular charity- they are your brethren in Faith thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who understand,To aga bea tuba jin acia sallah ku gikini acia zakka dukiyaazhi wa to azhe yegi yezhiani danona mini adinio Yi mae kpe ayazhi ye ka ka yin ya zanazhi ga de kpikpe na
But if they violate their oaths after their covenant and taunt you for your Faith- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith for their oaths are nothing to them that thus they may be restrained,Ama ga kuti nazhia zhi na lo ya baci na a alkawali jin na acie ke zhe tun adini ye zhi yan be egan de de zhi to egun dzoshicin yan kafirin ci zhi kun Hakika a ade kuti zhi yan gaskiya dan bea yina ujin wo be wunciy aga egwa kpe yan na akan-nao
Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths plotted to expel the Messenger and took the aggressive by being the first to assault you Do ye fear them Nay it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear if ye believe!,Kashi yea gun zana zhia kutizhiazhi leba na kuna ama kezhea kpa gan aga tuci nyan-dzun naa agama kayn dzun fi ye eti wun bo Soko tsa gwoyin na yea sundanu nao wuna yi mumini zhi ye yio na

Fight them and Allah will punish them by your hands cover them with shame help you to victory over them heal the breasts of Believers,E guna kun Sokoajina azaba be egwa ye zhi uma gaa sun zun ye umaa jine taimako ta etiabo uma ga fifo laadan yangban mumini zhio
And still the indignation of their hearts For Allah will turn in mercy to whom He will and Allah is All-Knowing All-Wise,U m a ga ewunzhe na fi yangbaazhio na la keyabo Soko maagwo tuba yan za na ga ba una Soko ma Etsu hikima Uyio
Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned as though Allah did not know those among you who strive with might and main and take none for friends and protectors except Allah His Messenger and the community of Believers But Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do,Kashi ye kpa ye kpa gan ala ye yea lugwa tun Soko laala elatu dan zanazhie jin jihidi mini yebo ama la zandondo zunma Soko be tuciu yin be mumini zhi eya man cia na Sokoma yi be kpikpe yan etun nazhi ye lo na
 It is not for such as join gods with Allah to visit or maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity The works of such bear no fruit In Fire shall they dwell,Ugwoyin ya mushiriki zhi naafe layedan masallaci Soko naa alaali ma atso jin ri ya titaacina be etun kafirinci nae lo na Zawuncinzhi etunazhi kpata-agbin ya ena bo amaaafi tu tun yino
 The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in Allah and the Last Day establish regular prayers and practise regular charity and fear none at all except Allah It is they who are expected to be on true guidance,Hakika de zanazhia la yedan masallaci Soko na aga yi zana zhi ga imani jin be Sokoe nao to be efo zobae ucia sallah kugikini na ucia zakka dukiyau wa nao gancin umae sundan zandoa sai de Soko To kengi uyio zawuncin zhia laafe dan mini eza bawuzhio
Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to the pious service of those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and strive with might and main in the cause of Allah They are not comparable in the sight of Allah and Allah guides not those who do wrong,Kashi ye ga eyanfinci na ye la ya alhaji zhi na to eye na ye ladan masallaci harami na lasan tatu be zanaa imani jin be Sokoe to be efo-zobae uci kezhe jin kokari ta ekpa Soko ebo elatu musulun ciona Afe yeni eba Soko boa Soko mae la jamaa yan azwalumi zhi ke eko gurua
 Those who believe and suffer exile and strive with might and main in Allah´s cause with their goods and their persons have the highest rank in the sight of Allah they are the people who will achieve salvation,Zana zhia imani jin na acia kpe la ke eyan de de lugwa na acie jin kokari ta eti ekpa Soko be dukiyaa zhi to rayia zhi na ayibe daraja na wancin gan na eba Soko zawunci zhi maaga yi eza rabo zhio
 Their Lord doth give them glad tidings of a Mercy from Himself of His good pleasure and of gardens for them wherein are delights that endure,Tsocia mae yaa labari yangbanfa be yegun ndoci dagan eba ubo ganna be yeda jin-y be emi aljanna zhi miniabo eman zhi danbo naazoa na
 They will dwell therein for ever Verily in Allah´s presence is a reward the greatest of all,Bagabo ma afi tutun yin-oHakika egagba na wancin na udan be sokoe
O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above Faith if any of you do so they do wrong,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Ega la mimaezhi to ye gi ezhi masoyi zhi ma a beke aga cin cin laaya kafirinci ta eti imanio na Za eni ndondo miniebo na ga laa masoyi na to zawunci zhi aga yi azwalumi zhio
 Say If it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred the wealth that ye have gained the commerce in which ye fear a decline or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than Allah or His Messenger or the striving in His cause- then wait until Allah brings about His decision and Allah guides not the rebellious,Gan cin  wuna yi gan ba ba ye zhi to egi ye zhi to yegi ye zhi to nyimi ye zhi ko eba yazhi to dangi ye zhi to dukiya nazhi ye kuyekan na to woce na ye sundan zunzunyana aga baye gan Soko to tuciu to kokari jin ta ekpa Soko-bo to eda zhi zhie har da kamina Sokogala umurni forondoci be na!

 Assuredly Allah did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain Behold! your great numbers elated you but they availed you naught the land for all that it is wide did constrain you and ye turned back in retreat,Hakika Soko jin ye taimako danna nazhi dokun nao to Efo Hunaynu kamina ekundo ye fe ya ye shaawa na uma kunke yaye wo be yandondo yina gancin ma kin cia yiku yaye bana ugwo dakan na gan cin yecia zunma zheta fe lo
But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers and sent down forces which ye saw not He punished the Unbelievers thus doth He reward those without Faith,Gancin Soko cia yangban shiu cin be ya tuciu to ya muminizhi uci cin ekun gun ci ndoci zhi be-yn na ye lea yea na uci jin zanazhia kafirinci jin na azaba wuncin ga ma yi egagba yan kafirizhio
 Again will Allah after this turn in mercy to whom He will for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Gancin zunma wuncino Soko cia -- tuba yan zanaga bauna Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean so let them not after this year of theirs approach the Sacred Mosque And if ye fear poverty soon will Allah enrich you if He wills out of His bounty for Allah is All-knowing All-wise,Ya ye nazhi imani jin na! Hakika mushirikizhi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na Shikan ayio ebo acino aga kara ye ba masallaci Harami baci eyaa nanao ma Ye ma gae sundan talauci to beleyin Sokoa jin kunkunke yaye dagan mini arzikiubo uga bau na Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe UyioEtsu hikima Uyio
 Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger nor acknowledge the religion of Truth even if they are of the People of the Book until they pay the Jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued,E gun zanazhie jin imani be Soko yinana to be Efozoba yinana ekun amae la yan na Soko be Tuciu yin gaa lazhe haramu na haramua na amae jin adini yan gaskiya tsoa fi mini zanazhi ala litafi ya na har sai aga edu yan jizya ya be egwaayin ama laafe eza gbagbangizhi
The Jews call ´Uzair a son of Allah and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah That is a saying from their mouth in this they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say Allah´s curse be on them how they are deluded away from the Truth!,Ya huduzhi ma gan uzairu egi Soko uyio Nasarazhi ma gan Masihu egi Soko uyi wuncin de eganuyio nae dagan be misunzhina Amae san Laana Soko kuti ta eti abo! Ki-ila acie pana ke eko guru lugwao
They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah and they take as their Lord Christ the son of Mary yet they were commanded to worship but One Allah there is no god but He Praise and glory to Him Far is He from having the partners they associate with Him,Yahuduzhi A man yanazhi la to Nasarazhi a man-yanazhi la tsocizhi baci Soko acia Masihu egi maryamu la acinga Ama jina umurni ndoci jina saide ajin bau taaya Tsoci Nini ke te gbuugi Ade Tsoci ndocia sai wyuny Lili maajin tabbata ya Soko ke yan nazhi e-la pau baci na lugwa
Fain would they extinguish Allah´s light with their mouths but Allah will not allow but that His light should be perfected even though the Unbelievers may detest it,E-wa gan a la haske-Sokoa nua ya be missunzhi Soko mae navo sai de uga haske u gun-mi kaa da ma kafiri zhi ga navo na
It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth to proclaim it over all religion even though the Pagans may detest it,Wyun gayi Etsu na tun Tuciu tun be bawuito be adini yan gaskiya yino na ebo ula wyunu lau ta eti Adinizhio kpata kaa da ma mushrikunazhi nazhie la yan pa Soko baci na  ga navo na
 O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder them from the way of Allah And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah announce unto them a most grievous penalty-Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! ,Hakika kundondo dagan mini Ahbaruzhio man yan yahuduzhi to Ruhba nuzhi man yan Nasarazhi a jinafe gi dukiya zazhi eti ganmanao amaajin afe kan zazhi eko Soko yin-da Za nazhi mae ku dukiya zinzriya be azarfae yekan na amae wua fi eko Soko boa na to yan azaba na yi tintanci na
On the Day when heat will be produced out of that wealth in the fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads their flanks and their backs their flanks and their backs- This is the treasure which ye buried for yourselves taste ye then the treasures ye buried!,Fo na aga pou ta eti dukiyao dan mini ena jahannamao na aci gau laabaa ye gunazhio to kansanazhio to zunmaazhioacia fe gana ganNana ga yi yanna ye tso ku yekan zhi-zhi ya eti tacin-yetso nao ebo acioo efe fin azaba yan yannazhi yetso fe ku yekan izheo na
 The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve in a year- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth of them four are sacred that is the straight usage So wrong not yourselves therein and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves,Hakika lisafi yan etswazhi nadan eya ninio eba Sokoo na uga yi etswa gu wo be guba yino kendoe uyi dan litafi Soko dagan fo-na ajin alitta sanmazhi to kin na miniabo ma gunni danbo nazhi yi Etswa alfurmazhi na Wuncin ga yi adini yan gboro Ebo acino ega jin ti tacin yezhi zwalunci fi bo ma Ye mae gun mushrikizhi bae nio kendoe atsoe gun ye baenio na Ye mae kpe ewo kede hakika Soko ajin udan be zanazhi gae tswau acie sundanunae
 The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve in a year- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth of them four are sacred that is the straight usage So wrong not yourselves therein and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves,Hakika lisafi yan etswazhi nadan eya ninio eba Sokoo na uga yi etswa gu wo be guba yino kendoe uyi dan litafi Soko dagan fo-na ajin alitta sanmazhi to kin na miniabo ma gunni danbo nazhi yi Etswa alfurmazhi na Wuncin ga yi adini yan gboro Ebo acino ega jin ti tacin yezhi zwalunci fi bo ma Ye mae gun mushrikizhi bae nio kendoe atsoe gun ye baenio na Ye mae kpe ewo kede hakika Soko ajin udan be zanazhi gae tswau acie sundanunae
 Verily the transposing of a prohibited month is an addition to Unbelief the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby for they make it lawful one year and forbidden another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by Allah and make such forbidden ones lawful The evil of their course seems pleasing to them But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith,Hakika de lila-lo yegboro yan Etswa Alfurma Na ye jin na bibe uyio dan mini kafirincio be wun ciny ma zanazhiajin kafirinci na elaagbin ke eko wangi lugwa ela etswa laazhe halali eya-ndoci eyandoci ma uulaazhe haramu ebo de ala emiguna laadan lisafi yane tswa na Soko lazhe haramu nao Ajin afe la yan-na Sokoa la jin haramu na aulazhe halali A etun dedezhi panin fia Soko mae la kafirizhi ke ekoa
 O ye who believe! what is the matter with you that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah ye cling heavily to the earth Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter But little is the comfort of this life as compared with the Hereafter,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! kii jin ye yeo kandondo na aga gan ye gan E nakin gun kun ta eti ekpa Soko na ye ajin yea nakanzhi lukpin kpe eti kinbo nao Kashi ye-yea ye dajin be eman edunfe izhe agan yan Efo zobaa Edunfe izhe ma ufe yandondo dan mini eku boa sai de te tengi
 Unless ye go forth He will punish you with a grievous penalty and put others in your place but Him ye would not harm in the least For Allah hath power over all things,Kagan ye dzu tinya da gunkuna Sokoa jine azaba na tan na uma gaa egwa-san laadane be jamaa ndocizhi na jin ye yana kinigibae bo ye maa la egun ndondo tsou woa Soko ma Etsu uyio na de kagbo ta eti yan dondo na
If ye help not your leader it is no matter for Allah did indeed help him when the Unbelievers drove him out he had no more than one companion they two were in the cave and he said to his companion Have no fear for Allah is with us then Allah sent down His peace upon him and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights for Allah is Exalted in might Wise,Ka-gan ye jinu taimakoa to hakika Sokouujin taimako ni kamina kafiri zhi nyanu dzun tinya uma yi zabaci yan zaguba kamina afi mini kpankoro na kamina ufe gan be masoyiu yin na ga nyinyangban ma hakika Soko danbo be yi yin Soko cia yangban shi cin bea yau uci jinu taimako be ekun gunci zhi na ye lea yea na ucia kalma yan kafiri zhi laagba ci takotako kalma yan Soko ma ugayi elatu cio Soko ma Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
 Go ye forth whether equipped lightly or heavily and strive and struggle with your goods and your persons in the cause of Allah That is best for you if ye but knew,Yea nakin da ekunda kamina ka ya kun-yezhi ga yi finfanci na to kamin uga lukpin na ye mae jin jihadi be dukiya yezhi to be rayi yezhi dan mini eko Soko Wunci ga yi alheri ya yeyeo ye gafe zanazhi de kpikpe na
If there had been immediate gain in sight and the journey easy they would all without doubt have followed thee but the distance was long and weighed on them They would indeed swear by Allah If we only could we should certainly have come out with you They would destroy their own souls for Allah doth know that they are certainly lying,Daaci gan ele na dan jihadio na u tso-tso ba ezan da na ma danbo na wunayi finfan ci uyio ekun dondoa aga mitu wyoe ammade wahala na danbo na wuna lokpa fia Amaafe zhi kuti be Sokoe Daaci gan yi de kafa de da yi ga tinya gan ni be ye yin Ejin titacina ci hallaka jin be kutizhi yan ganmanae Sokoma yi be kpi kpe ke de hakika ganmana zun ci zhi ayio na
 Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light and thou hadst proved the liars,Soko fa be lefi wyo-yin Kiila wyo ci yaa izini edun feo Har sia de eza gaskiya zhi gaa tula wyo cia ganmana zun ci zhi kpe ye
Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light and thou hadst proved the liars,Soko fa be lefi wyo-yin Kiila wyo ci yaa izini edun feo Har sia de eza gaskiya zhi gaa tula wyo cia ganmana zun ci zhi kpe ye
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons And Allah knoweth well those who do their duty,Zanazhi ga imani jin be Sokoe to be Efo zobae na aa wa izini wyoe ebo aga jin jihadi be dukiyaazhi to be rayia zhi maa Soko ma Etsu kpi kpe uyio yan zanazhi gae tswau amae sundanu nao
 Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro,Hakika de zanazhi wa izini wyoe gan a ya gunkunana agayi zanazhi jin imani be Sokoe to be efo zoba yinanao yangbanazhi mae jin kelo kezhin acia jin afe jin dalo-dazhin dan mini shakkaabo
If they had intended to come out they would certainly have made some preparation therefor but Allah was averse to their being sent forth so He made them lag behind and they were told Sit ye among those who sit inactive,Daacigan akpakpa gan a kpakpa aatinya lo jihadi daatso ga tattali jin wangi Soko ma navo na anakin na acia ekpin lu laadana edunfeo Aci ganagan Efe fedun ganni be zanazhie fe dun nae
If they had come out with you they would not have added to your strength but only made for disorder hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them But Allah knoweth well those who do wrong,Daaci gan a tin tin ya dan mini yebo daa beye be yandondo yina sai de eyan nyin da amaa dinye be lila-lo yan kulo-kuzhiny tsakaniebo afe wa fitina za ya ye Mini yebo ma tukpashici nazhia da wu yannna danbo Soko ma yi be kpikpe azwalumizhi
 Indeed they had plotted sedition before and upset matters for thee until- the Truth arrived and the Decree of Allah became manifest much to their disgust,Hakika shidzo ba tsozhio a wa fitina za har ma aalamari giye fi dozhi ya ya wyoe har ma gaskiya da be alamari Soko cia tula amaa fe zanazhie navo na
 Among them is many a man who says Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial Have they not fallen into trial already and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers on all sidesAma de dan miniabo naajin ugan gan ,Yami izini edunfe wyo mao ga la fitina tswanmi-maTo ngan a ya gun fitina boani Hakika ma ena yan jahanama ga kafirizhi ma kezhe

Say Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us He is our protector and on Allah let the Believers put their trustGangan ,Yandondoa tswan yi yia sai de yan na Soko ga ka ya yi na wyunga yi Ndakata yi yio Muminizhi ma alaa kpeatso Soko
Say Can you expect for us any fate other than one of two glorious things- Martyrdom or victory But we can expect for you either that Allah will send his punishment from Himself or by our hands So wait expectant we too will wait with you,Gancin kashi ye tu yandoci ye tu ya yi ban be nini mini bolo bolo gubae nasara ko tsu tsu eri Yi tso mae tu ye ya ye gan Soko ula azaba ndociube tswan ye dagan nkoubo koma be kagbo egwa yi yin To ezhibo fe tu-ye hakika yi tso yi tsoe tu ye ganni be ye yin

The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are that they reject Allah and His Messenger that they come to prayer without earnestness and that they offer contributions unwillingly,Uma jin yan-docikan aci gwo dukiya nazhia wu naayina sai de ebona hakika a kafirinci jin be Sokoe to be Tuciuyin na be ma enakin da jin sallaa sai de be nakan gbane a mae wu dukiyaa fi eko Soko boa sai de be nanvoe
Let not their wealth nor their following in sons dazzle thee in reality Allah´s plan is to punish them with these things in this life and that their souls may perish in their very denial of Allah,Ebo acino ga lugwa dukiyaazhi to egiazhi ya wyoe shahawa ma Hakika de Sokoe kpa-kpa gan wyunU lau jina azaba edunfe-izheo rayi azhi maalaa gan bea yin alaali ma ayi kafirizhi
 They swear by Allah that they are indeed of you but they are not of you yet they are afraid to appear in their true colours,Acie zhi kuti be Sokoe kede hakika mini yebo a dano na alaalima ujin mini yebo adana Amaade afe edansunci zhi
 If they could find a place to flee to or caves or a place of concealment they would turn straightaway thereto with an obstinate rush,Agade bandoci de naabici lo na ko ma kpankorozhi ko ma bandoci nada sogun na da aga zheban da ebau acia fe dinye
 And among them are men who slander thee in the matter of the distribution of the alms if they are given part thereof they are pleased but if not behold! they are indignant!,Amade dan miniabo nazhie gan-wyo-yin dan mini gingan sadakazhio na Kamina aga twarya yaa miniubo na afe fa yangban kagan ama twarya yaa dagan miniuboa wyoa leaye aga zhewun
 If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them and had said Sufficient unto us is Allah! Allah and His Messenger will soon give us of His bounty to Allah do we turn our hopes! that would have been the right course,Daaci gan a yeda jin jin be yan na Soko be Tuciu yin laayaa na aci gan Sokou kunu keu yayi Soko maa yayi dagan mini arziki ubo to Tuciu da wuna fe alheri yaa gan Hakika yi lo eba Soko tsa yie bavuno

 Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger is the Fire of Hell- wherein they shall dwell That is the supreme disgrace,Kashi a kpe kpea kede zandondo na gae le Soko ba be Tuciu yin na kede hakika ena jahannama gaajin tabbata ya wyuna Bagabo amaafi tutunyino Wuncin ma zunye sun uyio na gbota na
 The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them showing them what is really passing in their hearts Say Mock ye! But verily Allah will bring to light all that ye fear should be revealed,Munafukizhie sundan naacin sura ndoci be etiabo naa yaa labari yan yannazhi fi yangbanazhio na Gangan Efe lamide hakika Soko ga yan na ye sundan na laa tinya

 As in the case of those before you they were mightier than you in power and more flourishing in wealth and children They had their enjoyment of their portion and ye have of yours as did those before you and ye indulge in idle talk as they did They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter and they will lose all spiritual good,Ke kotonci yan zanazhi shi yedzo na agboka gan ye ama de dukiyazhi to egizhi gan ye aci wo ma be raboa yin yetso ma wo ma be rabo ye yin kendo zanazhi shiyedzo na wo ma be raboa yin na yema fe dzo izhe iri kendoe atso dzo izhe na Zawuncinzhi etunazhia gbinya izheo to ekuo zawuncizhi ma agayi eza hasarazhio
Hath not the story reached them of those before them- the People of Noah and ´Ad and Thamud the People of Abraham the men of Midian and the cities overthrown To them came their messengers with clear signs It is not Allah Who wrongs them but they wrong their own souls,Beke labari zanazhi shidzo na be ya aa na jamaa yan Nuhuzhi to Aduzhi to Samuduzhi to jamaa yan Ibrahimazhi to zaba madyana to kin nazhi azhekpe na Tuciazhi be yabe bayanizhi Umajin Soko jina zwaluncia amade atso tsa jin ti tacina zwaluncio
 The Believers men and women are protectors one of another they enjoin what is just and forbid what is evil they observe regular prayers practise regular charity and obey Allah and His Messenger On them will Allah pour His mercy for Allah is Exalted in power Wise,Mumini bagizhi to mumini yinzagizhi sashiazhi masoyizhi ayio ya sashi ejin foro be etun guruzhi a mae kan etu dedezhi amae ku sallah gikini amae wa zakka dukiyaazhi amae gba Soko be Tuciu yin Zawuncin zhi Sokoa gunaye Hakika Soko Etsu zankpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
Allah hath promised to Believers men and women gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah that is the supreme felicity,Soko jin mumini bagizhi to mumini yinzagizhi alkawali wyuna laa gandan emi Aljannazhio nazhi sangizhie je fi takoabona amaafibofi tutunyin be edunfe ba managizhi dan mini emi Aljannazhio ganni be yeda jiny dagan eba Soko natso wancin ganna Wuncin ga yi rabo na wancin nao
 O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites and be firm against them Their abode is Hell- an evil refuge indeed,Ya wyoe Annabi! Gun kafirizhi to munafikizhi kun wyo mao lao kuo gikini beayin be kagboe Ezhekebaa ma uga yi jahannamao Bibi maajin tabbata ya ezhe keba wuncin
They swear by Allah that they said nothing evil but indeed they uttered blasphemy and they did it after accepting Islam and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out this revenge of theirs was their only return for the bounty with which Allah and His Messenger had enriched them! If they repent it will be best for them but if they turn back to their evil ways Allah will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter They shall have none on earth to protect or help them,Ajin afe zhi kuti be Sokoe ke aganacina na alalima hakika agan gan yan kafirinci amaajin kafirinci baci musulunciabo ama jin kokari dan wiwa yan na ade jin jin wuna na uga yi wuwu nae wagan a wu Annabi nao Haushiama fea saide ebo na Soko be Tuciu yinyaa kunkunke dagan arziki ubo nao To aga tu ba jin wuncinajin alheri yaagan amaga zuma zheta Sokoa jina azaba azaba na tan sarauyin na dan mini izheo to ekuo amaade masoyi ndoci ko taimako jinci ndoci dan mini kin boa
Amongst them are men who made a covenant with Allah that if He bestowed on them of His bounty they would give largely in charity and be truly amongst those who are righteous,A ma de miniabo najin Soko alkawali na Hakika Soko ga twarya yayi dagan mini falalaubo hakika yi yiajin sadaka hakika ma yi gafe da mini zaguruzhio
 But when He did bestow of His bounty they became covetous and turned back from their covenant averse from its fulfilment,Kamina ubea la yaa dagan mini falalaubo na acia yanbotan beuyin acia zunma zheta aciapanya ke shishe alkawali lugwa
 But when He did bestow of His bounty they became covetous and turned back from their covenant averse from its fulfilment,Kamina ubea la yaa dagan mini falalaubo na acia yanbotan beuyin acia zunma zheta aciapanya ke shishe alkawali lugwa
So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts to last till the Day whereon they shall meet Him because they broke their covenant with Allah and because they lied again and again,Ucia zoba alamaria laafe munafinci dan mini yangbanabo har da fo na aga be gun be uyin na ebo lenba yan alkawali naajin Soko na to ganmana nae zun nao
Know they not that Allah doth know their secret thoughts and their secret counsels and that Allah knoweth well all things unseen,Kashi ade kpikpe dea kede hakika Soko yibe kpikpe yan asiriazhi to egan swiswociazhia kede hakikama Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yannazhia swokpata naa
Those who slander such of the believers as give themselves freely to deeds of charity as well as such as can find nothing to give except the fruits of their labour- and throw ridicule on them- Allah will throw back their ridicule on them and they shall have a grievous penalty,Zanazhie gangan dede yan aibi eti zanazhie lo tun alheri mini muminizhio ebo sadaka jino na to zanazhi de yan dondoa saide naaga da jin kokari cide na acie laajin sadaka na gancin acie laa mi Sokoa gaagba be emi laazhi azaba nama tan na wunajin tabbata yaa
 Whether thou ask for their forgiveness or not their sin is unforgivable if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness Allah will not forgive them because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger and Allah guideth not those who are perversely rebellious,Ka wyo ga ba gafara yaa koma wyo ba gafara yaaye ni uyio ka wyo ga wa gafara yaa zu adwani to Sokoa fa bea yina Ebo na ajin kafirinci be Sokoe to be Tuciu yin Soko mae la fasikizhi ke eko gurua
Those who were left behind in the Tabuk expedition rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the Messenger of Allah they hated to strive and fight with their goods and their persons in the cause of Allah they said Go not forth in the heat Say The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat If only they could understand!,Zanazhia yadan zunmao na afa yangban be edun naafe zunma yan Tuci Soko na ama navo naajin jihadi be dukiyaazhi to be rayiazhi dan eko Soko na aci gan Ega dzuntinya lo ekunda dan ba nawo yan yigidioma Gangan Ngan ena jahannamam wona gan sarauyin Daaci gan egan gae yea ye na
 Let them laugh a little much will they weep a recompense for the evil that they do,Ebo acino aga man-tsan aman-tsan degi amaa tigi na dokun na wuncin mayi egagba yan woce dede nae ce na
 If then Allah bring thee back to any of them and they ask thy permission to come out with thee say Never shall ye come out with me nor fight an enemy with me for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion Then sit ye now with those who lag behind,To Soko ga bea wyo la zheban da eba jamaa ndocizhi miniabo aci wa izini be wyo yin yan tintinya to gangan yea tinya be mi yina har abada ye maa gun makiri ndondo kun be mi yina Hakika ye yea ye da jin be edunfe ca bae be dzo ebo acino eda fedune be inzagizhi nazhie fe dun zhi zunmao na
Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies nor stand at his grave for they rejected Allah and His Messenger and died in a state of perverse rebellion,Wyo mao ga jin sallah ta eti ekun zaeni ndondo nagaa tsu na ma har abada wyo mao ga gikini eba kabari ubo ma Hakika aajin kafirinci be Sokoe to be Tuciu yin amaa tsu alalima ayi fasikizhi

When a Sura comes down enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive and fight along with His Messenger those with wealth and influence among them ask thee for exemption and say Leave us behind we would be with those who sit at home,Gancin ma aga sura cinzhin kede yea imani jin be Sokoe na ye mae jin jihadi ganni be Tuciu yin Zanazhi yi eza bagwozhi miniabo na afe wa izini wyoe acia gangan A yi ya be zanazhi fedun zhizhi nbo na
 They prefer to be with the women who remain behind at home their hearts are sealed and so they understand not,A yeda jin kede a zhia nbo ganni be inzagizhina Acia yangbanzhi te ebo acino eganzhi cie yea bea
 But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive and fight with their wealth and their persons for them are all good things and it is they who will prosper,Ammade Tuci soko to zanazhia imani jin be uyin na ajin jihadi kokari ta eti ekpa Soko be dukiyazhi to rayiazhi Zawuncinzhi yi be egagba yan alherizhi za wuncinzhi ma agayi eza rabozhio
Allah hath prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein that is the supreme felicity,Soko jin shiri yaa yan Aljannazhi na nuwan zhie je fi takoa bo na amaa fibo tutunyin Wuncin ga ma yi rabo na wancin nao
And there were among the desert Arabs also men who made excuses and came to claim exemption and those who were false to Allah and His Messenger merely sat inactive Soon will a grievous penalty seize the Unbelievers among them,Zanazhi yi eza uzurizhi mini za banzunmazhio na cida be ebo ajin izinia yaaa zanazhi ma zunwan ta Soko be Tuciu yin na a feduna zhizhi Be le yin azaba na tanna gaa zanazhi jin kafirinci miniabo nade
There is no blame on those who are infirm or ill or who find no resources to spend on the cause if they are sincere in duty to Allah and His Messenger no ground of complaint can there be against such as do right and Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Le fi danbo ta eti eza gbogun zhi boa to guncizhi lefi ma ta eti zanazhi ade yan naawu fi eko Soko onaa aga yanagbanazhi tadzu ebo Soko be Tuciu yin naa Le fi ndondo ma ta eti zanazhie jin bolobolonaa Soko ma Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun

They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them Say thou Present no excuses we shall not believe you Allah hath already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you It is your actions that Allah and His Messenger will observe in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knoweth what is hidden and what is open then will He show you the truth of all that ye did,Afe la uzuriazhi be eba ye kamina ye ga zheban da tsuna na Gangan yia ya ye gaskiyaa Hakika Soko ya yi labari mini labari yezhi boani Soko maale etun yezhi ye to Tuciu maa le ye Gancin acia la ye zhebanlo eba Etsu na wun kpikpe yan naaswo kpata na to naa tula na Ucia yaye labari yan etun nazhi ye lo pkata na
 They will swear to you by Allah when ye return to them that ye may leave them alone So leave them alone For they are an abomination and Hell is their dwelling-place-a fitting recompense for the evil that they did,Afezhi kuti ya ye be Sokoe kamina ye ga zheban da tsuna na ebode ye lae dzun ganabo to yea dzun ganabo hakika shikan ayio ecin baa ma uga yi jahannamao wuncin ma yi egagba yan woce nazhie ce na

The Arabs of the desert are the worst in Unbelief and hypocrisy and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which Allah hath sent down to His Messenger But Allah is All-knowing All-Wise,Eza banzunmazhi a gbo ka gan eba kafirinci jiny be munafinci jiny aga ma -- aci yin gano ebo na ade kpikpe yan hukuncizhi na Soko cin be ya Tuciu naa Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
 Some of the desert Arabs look upon their payments as a fine and watch for disasters for you on them be the disaster of evil for Allah is He That heareth and knoweth all things,Ama de dan mini eza banzunmazhio nazhie le yanna uga wu fi eko Soko na ye ke dashi na acia jin afe wa gan masibazhi alaa cina dan ye cincin yan masibazhi eti atso bo wuna tao Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio
 But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day and look on their payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to Allah and obtaining the prayers of the Messenger Aye indeed they bring them nearer to Him soon will Allah admit them to His Mercy for Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful,Amade dan mini eza banzunmazhio naa imani jin be Sokoe to be efo zobae na amae la yan nazhi aga wu na ke eyan tsonbazhi na ayio lo eba Soko umayi aduwayan salati ya Tuci Soko na Acin ga gao hakika ugaazhe tsonba yaa be Sokoe Soko magaa la gandan mini yegunubo Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
The vanguard of Islam- the first of those who forsook their homes and of those who gave them aid and also those who follow them in all good deeds- well-pleased is Allah with them as are they with Him for them hath He prepared gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein for ever that is the supreme felicity,Zanazhi maa shidzo amayi za mafarizhi mini muhajiruzhio to ansaruzhi na to zanazhi la mitua zunmao be etun wangizhina Sokoa yeda jin bea yin atso maajin beUyin Umajin shiri yaa yan Emi aljannazhi na nuwan zhie je dan takoubo na amaa fi bo fi tutun yin Wuncin ga yi rabo na wancin nao
Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites as well as desert Arabs among the Medina folk they are obstinate in hypocrisy thou knowest them not We know them twice shall We punish them and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty,To dagan mini zanazhi maye -- ba mini banzunmacizhio na munafikizhi dan miniabo to mini za zhi-nin yan Madinao zanazhi gi gba ta eti munafuncio na dan bo wyoa kpea yea Yi tsa kpea yeo Bele yin Yia jina azaba zu-guba gancin be acia laa zhebanlo azaba natso wancin na
 Others there are who have acknowledged their wrong-doings they have mixed an act that was good with another that was evil Perhaps Allah will turn unto them in Mercy for Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful,To ndocizhi ma danbo atsoa ye da jin be lefiazhi a emi --  a etun wangi bokeba be ndoci nayi dede nae Kengi uyio na Sokoagwo tuba jina na Hakika Soko Etsu gafara uyio Etsu yegun uyio
Of their goods take alms that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them and pray on their behalf Verily thy prayers are a source of security for them And Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth-- ,sadaka dagan mini dukiyaazhio wyoolaadi wyo laao tadzu beuyin Wyo mae ba aduwao yaa Hakika aduwa wyo-zhi yangban cin ta uyio Yaao Soko ma Etsu nae wo yandondo na uyio Etsu kpikpe uyio

And say Work righteousness Soon will Allah observe your work and His Messenger and the Believers Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of what is hidden and what is open then will He show you the truth of all that ye did,Wyo mae gangan Efe lo tun bele yin Sokoa le etune ye to Tuci wuna le ye  to muninizhi gancin ma aga ye laa zheban da eba Etsu na wun kpikpe yan naaso na to naa tula na gancin ucia ya ye labari etun nazhi ye lo na
 There are yet others held in suspense for the command of Allah whether He will punish them or turn in mercy to them and Allah is All-Knowing Wise,To ndocizhi ma danbo nazhi epata ya hukunci Soko eti abona ko uga bau ujina azaba ko ma wyuna bau ujina gafara Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima uyio
And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity - to disunite the Believers - and in preparation for one who warred against Allah and His Messenger aforetime They will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good But Allah doth declare that they are certainly liars,Za nazhi maa masallaci la ebo egun jino na be kafirinci be gingan kpere-kpere tsakani musulumizhio na be esobae ya za nazhie gun Soko be Tuciu yin ekun shido batsozhio na hakika ma a fe zhi kuti ganyide kpa yandondoa sai de alheri alali ma sokoe jin ri ke hakika gan mana zuncizhi ayio na
Never stand thou forth therein There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety it is more worthy of the standing forth for prayer therein In it are men who love to be purified and Allah loveth those who make themselves pure,Ga gikini jin salla miniabo ma har abada Hakika masallaci naa tu ta dansun Soko dagan caba efoe na uga -- yin gan na wyoe jin salla dan miniubo nao Miniubo eza bagi ndocizhi danbo nazhie wa lili na hakika ma Soko ajin ufe wa eza lilicizhi
Which then is best - he that layeth his foundation on piety to Allah and His good pleasure - or he that layeth his foundation on an undermined sand-cliff ready to crumble to pieces and it doth crumble to pieces with him into the fire of Hell And Allah guideth not people that do wrong,Ngba za naa eba u tu ta eti dan sun Sokoo be wiwa yan yedau yin na uga de alheri gano-kashi za na la ba tuu ta eti gushe misuno nae wa gan wuna banfi na Ucia banfi be wyun tsoe dan mini ena jahannamao Soko mae la jamaa yan azwalumizhi ke eko gurua
The foundation of those who so build is never free from suspicion and shakiness in their hearts until their hearts are cut to pieces And Allah is All-Knowing Wise,Eba natu na wuna la keyaboa ugaazhe eyan ke lo kezhin fi yangbanazhio har da kamina yangbanazhia bea sa ya na Soko ma Etsu kpikpe uyio Etsu hikima
Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods for theirs in return is the garden of Paradise they fight in His cause and slay and are slain a promise binding on Him in truth through the Law the Gospel and the Qur´an and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded that is the achievement supreme,Hakika Sokoa shi dagan eba muminizhio rayiazhi to dukiyazhi ebo egagba aljanna naa la yaa na Zawuncinzhie gun kun dan eko Soko gancin ma e wuzazhi amae wu atso ma Alkawali Soko uyio yan hakika dan mini Attaurao to Injeela to Kuranuo Ziima she alkawali wo agan SokooEbo acino efe fa yangban be Sokoe na Wuncin ga ma yi rabo ba wancin nao
Those that turn to Allah in repentance that serve Him and praise Him that wander in devotion to the cause of Allah that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer that enjoin good and forbid evil and observe the limit set by Allah- These do rejoice So proclaim the glad tidings to the Believers,Za nazhie jin tuba na zanazhie jin bauta ya Soko na zanazhie jin yebo ya Soko na zanazhie fe azum na zanazhie jin rukuna zanazhie jin sujada na zanazhie jin dozhi foro be etun wangi na zanazhie kan etun dede na to za nazhie tswa iyaka Soko zhina Wyo mao ya labari yangban fao ya Muminizhi
It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should pray for forgiveness for Pagans even though they be of kin after it is clear to them that they are companions of the Fire,Ugwo yin ya Annabi to zanazhia imani jin naa naaba gafara ya zanazhie la yan pa Soko baci naa kaa da ma agafe eza afe eza ena jahimuzhi naa
 And Abraham prayed for his father´s forgiveness only because of a promise he had made to him But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allah he dissociated himself from him for Abraham was most tender-hearted forbearingGafara na ma Ibrahima wa ya babauna u fea sai de ebo alkawali ndoci naujinuna kamina ma ubea tula yau kede hakika babau wunazhe makiri Soko na wyuna egwau wa be uyio Hakika Ibrahima za nae dokun be adwa jin nae uyio eza hakuri uyio,
 And Allah will not mislead a people after He hath guided them in order that He may make clear to them what to fear and avoid- for Allah hath knowledge of all things,Soko ma wyune gbin jamaa ndondoa baci na ugawuba naa sai de uga bayani jin yabedzo yan yannazhi -- yin a tswa na Hakika Soko Etsu kpikpe uyio yan yandondo
 Unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth He giveth life and He taketh it Except for Him ye have no protector nor helper,Hakika Soko ga wun mulki sanmazhi to kin yino Wyune dan rayi umae wu rayi Ye ma de zan doci baci soko naa fe ndakata be taimako jinci ya ye naa
Allah turned with favour to the Prophet the Muhajirs and the Ansar- who followed him in a time of distress after that the hearts of a part of them had nearly swerved from duty but He turned to them also for He is unto them Most Kind Most Merciful,Hakika Sokoa tuba yan Annabi gwo to muhajirunazhi nazhi kpela dagan makao lo madina na  to Ansaruzhi madinacizhi nazhia mi tu Annabi dan lokaci yan ezoona baci na yangban Zandoncizhi miniabo a tsoba na uga zhegba na gancin Soko ci gwo tubaa  Hakika Soko Etsu tosayi Uyio Etsu yegun Uyio
 He turned in mercy also to the three who were left behind they felt guilty to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them for all its spaciousness and their very souls seemed straitened to them- and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah and no refuge but to Himself Then He turned to them that they might repent for Allah is Oft-Returning Most Merciful,Soko ma gwo tuba yan zaguta nazhia badan zunmaonahar ma kin nana wua pina bana ugwope da kan na rayi azhicia pin atso atso cia kpe wo kede edzunba ndondo danbo dagan eba Sokoboa saide be ebanzhe lo ebau na Gancin Soko ci gwa tubaaebo ma ade baa laa kua gikini be tuba jiny Hakika Soko Etsu nae -- tuba na uyio etsu yegun Uyio
 O ye who believe! Fear Allah and be with those who are true in word and deed,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Etswa Soko ye mae sundanu ye mae lae fe dan tacin eza gaskiya zhio
It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs of the neighbourhood to refuse to follow Allah´s Messenger nor to prefer their own lives to his because nothing could they suffer or do but was reckoned to their credit as a deed of righteousness- whether they suffered thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah or trod paths to raise the ire of the Unbelievers or received any injury whatever from an enemy for Allah suffereth not the reward to be lost of those who do good-,Ugwo yin na jamaa yan Madinacizhi to za nazhi maa gwo ba dagan mini za banzunmazhio na na aga ce leba gbigba yan Tuci Soko naa amaaga wa rayiazhi agan rayiu ma Wuncin ma yi ebo na nun-wo ndondo na ga woa na to wahala to madan naga guna dan eko Soko na be ezan ndondo naaga da naala hankali kafirizhi nakin na saide egagba yan etun alheri ka yaa Hakika Soko wyune ta etun zaguruzhi yakpea
Nor could they spend anything for the cause - small or great- nor cut across a valley but the deed is inscribed to their credit that Allah may requite their deed with the best possible reward,To yandondo na aga wu tetengi na to wanciko naaga wu na to kpankoro na aga labici dana sai Soko ga laada ka yaa ebo Sokou gaagba be egagba na gyegan etu nazhi afe lo na
 Nor should the Believers all go forth together if a contingent from every expedition remained behind they could devote themselves to studies in religion and admonish the people when they return to them- that thus they may learn to guard themselves against evil,Uma gwayin na Musulumizhi kpata ga tinya da ekunda naa kia la acia de jamaa ndocizhi dagan mini kansan ndondo nazhia tinya da wa fahimta adini zaa naa yino Ebo ajin jamaa yanazhi gangba kamina aga zheban lo ebaa na ujin wo be wunciny aga fe za nazhie tswa do ka Soko na
 O ye who believe! fight the unbelievers who gird you about and let them find firmness in you and know that Allah is with those who fear Him,Ya ye nazhia imani jin na! Egun kafiri nazhie tsoba ye na kun Amaa tsun ye be kagboe ye mae kpe wo kede Soko wyunajin udanbe zanazhi gae tswaU acia sundanu na
Whenever there cometh down a sura some of them say Which of you has had His faith increased by it Yea those who believe- their faith is increased and they do rejoice,Ama ga sura ndoci cin be ade dan miniabo naajin ugangan Ngba zii mini yebo egan nanazhi bea imanio To ammade zanazhia imani jin na ubea imaniamae fa yangban be uyio
 But those in whose hearts is a disease- it will add doubt to their doubt and they will die in a state of Unbelief,Amaade za nazhi batan fi yangbanazhio na ubea shikan be ta eti shikanazhio acia tsu alaali ma ayi kafirizhi
See they not that they are tried every year once or twice Yet they turn not in repentance and they take no heed,Kashi ale ye le gan eman acin le be fitinazhi mini eya ndondo zunni koma zu gubaa Gancin ma ejin tuubaa amae kpa yea
See they not that they are tried every year once or twice Yet they turn not in repentance and they take no heed,Kashi ale ye le gan eman acin le be fitinazhi mini eya ndondo zunni koma zu gubaa Gancin ma ejin tuubaa amae kpa yea
Whenever there cometh down a Sura they look at each other saying Doth anyone see you Then they turn aside Allah hath turned their hearts from the light for they are a people that understand not,Kamina ma aga sura ndoci cin be na sashiazhi miniabo ciafe baye cin sashi le agan gan Ngba ade zandoci nae le ye ye na Gancin aci ga zhe ban Soko mae la yangbanazhi zhegba ebo na hakika afe jamaa nazhie de fahimta naa na
Now hath come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves it grieves him that ye should perish ardently anxious is he over you to the Believers is he most kind and merciful,Hakika Tuci be ya ye dagan mini yebo Yandondo nae ya ye wahala na wune gbo fiu Wyune bavun alherizhi ya ye Uma yi eza tosayi eza yegun be muminizhi
 But if they turn away Say Allah sufficeth me there is no god but He On Him is my trust- He the Lord of the Throne of Glory Supreme!To aga zunma zheta gangan ,Zanaa kunke yami na uga yi Soko Ade zan dondo na -- yin awunu be gaskiyae naa sai Wyin Wyun gama mi yakpeo wyun-ga ma yi Etsu Alarashi na wancin nao
 I do call to witness this City-,MIE zhi kuti be ezhi wanciko nanae U gayi Makao
And thou art a freeman of this City-,Akika ma edunfe yan wyoe halali uyio dan mini zhinin nanao
And the mystic ties of parent and child-,Sokoe zhi kuti be yanmanci to zuriyauzhi kpatae
 Verily We have created man into toil and struggle,Akika Yi jin halitta zawangi jin dan mini bauta yan edunfe yizheo
Thinketh he that none hath power over him,Zawangi ekpaye kpa gan zaeni ndondo de kagbo ta etiu boa
He may say boastfully Wealth have I squandered in abundance!,Zawangi ga jin u fe gangan akika wunde ewu dukiya na dokun nan fi eko alheri zhio umaafe gangan eti fario
 Thinketh he that none beholdeth him,Zawangi ekpaye kpa gan ade zaeni ndondo nae cinu le naa
 Have We not made for him a pair of eyes-,Asaa Yi jin eye guba ya zawangia
 And a tongue and a pair of lips-,Ganni be gintarae be emi kpere guba yina
And shown him the two highways,Yici kezhea eko gubaba Eko yan etun guru to etun dede laawu wuna
But he hath made no haste on the path that is steep,Ammade zawangi wunekpa dida yan eko nazo umaalau tso guri alhairi naa
And what will explain to thee the path that is steep-,Annabi! Kiima a la eko natso zo umaa laa tso gurina wu wyo yio
It is freeing the bondman,Ugayiezau wa ba--u ya wuzhi na dan bauta zawangio nan
Or the giving of food in a day of privation,Ko ezau ya talakazhi yangiciagi lokaci na madan be wahala edunfe yizhe ga gangan na
To the orphan with claims of relationship,Ye mae fe gunye ekungizhi nazhi tsoba ye dangiboo nan
 Or to the indigent down in the dust,Ye mae fe gunye eza gwagbagizhi nazhie zhi kinbo
Then will he be of those who believe and enjoin patience constancy and self-restraint and enjoin deeds of kindness and compassion,Be nnazhii kpaata ucia fe dan mini mumini zhio acie jin dozhi gangba ganni be hakuri amaa fe zanazhi ewo yegun dozhi nan
 Such are the Companions of the Right Hand,Eza iri wuncinzhi agayi eza gwaalo zhio eza guruzhi
 But those who reject Our Signs they are the unhappy Companions of the Left Hand,Zanazhi ma gae jin kafirci be aya Yizhina akika agayi zaba gwaapin zhio eza dede zhi
On them will be Fire vaulted over all round,Za wuncinzhi enan gaa ma nakana kezhe kpaata ba ga bo afio a tinya boa
By the Sun and his glorious splendour,Sokoe zhi kuti be yigidii lokacina haskeu gae na laazhiny nan

And its enlightenment as to its wrong and its right-,Soko cia kpikpe la wu rayi ndondo yan yanazhi yi enyan dedezhi be yanazhi yi wangizhi nan
Truly he succeeds that purifies it,Akika Zaeni ndondo na ga yangbanu tadzu na wuna de rabo
 And he fails that corrupts it!,Akika zaeni ndondoro na ga yangbanu shizhiko na wuna jin hasara to yizhe to eku
The Thamud people rejected their prophet through their inordinate wrong-doing,Akika Samuduzhi Nazhi a tun Annabi Salihu fi na a aya Soko yi ganmana be gbingbintui be lefi Soko nazhia fe jinna
Behold the most wicked man among them was deputed for impiety,Kamina zana jin shakii gan miniabo na nakin nan
But the Messenger of Allah said to them It is a She-camel of Allah! And bar her not from having her drink!,Tuci Soko Annabi salihu cia gan yaa gan rakun yiwo wuncin yan Soko uyio ebo acino elugwa u fin nuwan
Then they rejected him as a false prophet and they hamstrung her So their Lord on account of their crime obliterated their traces and made them equal in destruction high and low!,Acia egan Annabi yi ganmanan acia rakun yiwo wuncin wu ebo acino Tsocia cicin azaba dede be taa azaba wuncin cia fin ya kpata acia jin dai dai gangani be jikanna kin yin
And for Him is no fear of its consequences,Dansun ndondo ma danbo yan iri yana ayi zoba zanazhi ele Soko ba naa
By the Night as it conceals the light,Sokoe zhi kuti be yeshii lokacina ugaa lakpe yandoro nan
 By the Day as it appears in glory,Sokoe zhi kuti be batin yan efoe lokacina uga tula nan
 By the mystery of the creation of male and female-,Sokoe zhi kuti be kendoe ujin alitta zhi jin bagi be yinzagi nan
Verily the ends ye strive for are diverse,Akika etun nazhi ye lona kakaa yin uyio
 So he who gives in charity and fears Allah,Amaade zaeni ndoro na gae twarya be dukiya na Soko la yau nan ucie kezhe sundan Soko danbo nan
And in all sincerity testifies to the best-,Ucia gaskiya ya ganni be bolobolo yan addini musuluncii na wunejin addini kendoe Soko be Tuciu yin wa nan
We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Bliss,Yi ga sauki laadan eko nazhi ugaada ci tso guriu yan yizhe to kiyamae na yau
But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient,Amaade zaeni ndondo na na gae tanyabo ci gan wuna kunke yaeti tacinu nan
And gives the lie to the best-,Uci kezhea ganmana laadan bolobolo yan musuluncio nan To addini wune jin wangi bea ebo dukiya yizheo na
 We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Misery,Akika yiga eko yan wahala laafan fiu
 Nor will his wealth profit him when he falls headlong into the Pit,Dukiyauzhi kpaata na u kuyekan nan wuna kunke ta wuna lokacina ugaada logun enao naa
Verily We take upon Ourselves to guide,Akika bawu kpaata e bayi Soko bo udano
And verily unto Us belong the End and the Beginning,Akika ma yiga wun zoba yizheo yi gama wun to cabao tso
Therefore do I warn you of a Fire blazing fiercely,Ebo acino Mie jin zawangizhi gangba ye tswa enan yan Lazwa Ena uyio nae gi epa to tsukun zawangi na
 None shall reach it but those most unfortunate ones,Amade zanaalo enan nanan naa sai dai shakkizhi eza lefi Soko
Who give the lie to Truth and turn their backs,Ugayi zana addini yi ganmana nan cike zhea zunma ceta imani jin be Sokoe nan
But those most devoted to Allah shall be removed far from it-,Zanazhi ma yi eza dansun Sokozhina aga kpeya be eza aba yan ena wunciny
 Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification,Aga zhi yi zanazhi ewu dukiyaa fi eko Sokoo ebo ude lili yan yangban be tsonba Sokoe nao
 And have in their minds no favour from anyone for which a reward is expected in return,Amade zaeni ndoro nade eyan niima zhi naawa egagba yan etun guru ebau bo naa
But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord Most High,Muminizhi elotun guru lo ebo kauna be  wiwa yan yarda yan Tsoci yin Etsu nanalatu ta eti alttazhio kpaata nan
 And soon will they attain complete satisfaction,Akika ma bele yin a bea tso guri
And soon will they attain complete satisfaction,Akika ma bele yin a bea tso guri
 By the Glorious Morning Light,Sokoe zhi kuti be lokaci yan walhae uga yi lokaci na yigidi gaala tinya nao
And by the Night when it is still-,Sokoe zhi kuti be yeshi lokacina bazhikou gaalakpe yandoro nan
Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee nor is He displeased,Akika Tsoci wye ujin wyoe kpaamua u ma nawo voa
 And verily the Hereafter will be better for thee than the present,Akika ma izhe batsozhi ude alhairi ya wyoe gan izhe nannan
 And soon will thy Guardian-Lord give thee that wherewith thou shalt be well-pleased,Akika Tsoci wyoe wuna twarya ya wyoe yangban wyo ma gaa fa beuyin
Did He not find thee an orphan and give thee shelter and care,Asa ujin ekungi wyo yia Soko cia wyoe wandana
 And He found thee wandering and He gave thee guidance,Wyo ma yi eza na agbin nan ucia wyo wubaa
And He found thee in need and made thee independent,Wyo ma yi talaka nade yandondoa na Soko cia ba-- jin ya wyo yaa
Therefore treat not the orphan with harshness,Ebo acino ga fe yiba-ba ekungizhima
 Nor repulse the petitioner unheard,Zana ma gae ba yan na ga sunbauu ma
Nor repulse the petitioner unheard,Zana ma gae ba yan na ga sunbauu ma
 But the bounty of the Lord - rehearse and proclaim!,Niima yangban fa ndoro na Soko ga jin ya wye na lau wu ganni be jin jin yan yebo na dokun nan
Have We not expanded thee thy breast-,Asaa Yi la ba-- dan yangban wobo ya wyo yaa ebo wodebao jin hakuri eti bayi-ba ndoro na wyo ga leye ekon nao naa
 And removed from thee thy burden,Yi cia amana na lukpin sarauyin na -- la ya wyo yaa
The which did gall thy back-,Amana naa lukpin sarauyin ta wye zunmao nan
And raised high the esteem in which thou art held,Yima kezhea yetun wye latu dan sanmao to kinbo
 So verily with every difficulty there is relief,Akika bayiba ndoro uyi pamba be saukii naa gbau zunma nan
 Verily with every difficulty there is relief,Akika bayiba ndoro uyibe sauki yin
 Therefore when thou art free from thine immediate task still labour hard,Ebo acino kandondo na wyo ga ibada jin zo na aku gikini be aduwae wyo mao feo wu evun baolo eba Tsoci wyoe

By the Fig and the Olive,Soko zhi kuti be cigban yan tinui be zaitunii
And the Mount of Sinai,Sokoe zhi kuti be pati yan sinai ugayi pati na Sokoa gangan be Annabi Musae na
And this City of security-,Sokoe zhi kuti be Makkae nayi Ezhi aminci nae
We have indeed created man in the best of moulds,Akika Yi jin halitta yan zawangi jin be siffa be kinigi-I na gye sarauyin nan
Then do We abase him to be the lowest of the low-,Yi ci kezheu lada zhin tako tako yan halittazhi kpaata
 Except such as believe and do righteous deeds For they shall have a reward unfailing,Sai dai zanazhi ga imani jin na acie kezhe lotun guru zhina hakika zawuncinzhi Sokoa gagba be Niimauzhi naa zoa nan
 Then what can after this contradict thee as to the judgment to come,Kijin wyo yio Wyo cie dza Efo egagba wano
Is not Allah the wisest of judges,Asa Ujin Soko gayi Etsu nae ba hukunci ta eti zanazhie ba hukunci kpaata naa
When the earth is shaken to her utmost convulsion,Soko zhi kuti be lokaci na agaabe du kin nanna dudu yan iyaka nan
And the earth throws up her burdens from within,Kanga yan nafi ni yanu bo nan ci gaa tinya kpaata
 And man cries distressed ´What is the matter with her´-,Zawangi ndoro cia fe gangan kii ma jin kin nannan yin nano
 On that Day will she declare her tidings,Fo wuncin kin yinotso a ta labari yanna udany nin bo na
For that thy Lord will have given her inspiration,Ebona Tsoci Wyoe jinu foro be acinga yino na
 On that Day will men proceed in companies sorted out to be shown the deeds that they had done,Efo wuncin zawangizhi kpaata gaa kpa ekpo ekpo zaeni ndoro a wa gan wyunu le egagba yan etun wunu ye
 And anyone who has done an atom´s weight of evil shall see itZaeni ndoro na ga lotun kotonkoci yan zarra na wuna yi sharrio wuna le yanu ye,

And push home the charge in the morning,Sokoe zhi kutibe ekun gunci yan Musulumizhi lokacina agae da dzun fi makiyi Sokozhi be ekuny laazhin fuu yin nan
And raise the dust in clouds the while,Acie la rungba nakin be eci yan dokozhiinan
And penetrate forthwith into the midst of the foe en masse-,Aciela jamaa yan kafirizhi kufi taacino kpaata nan
 Truly man is to his Lord ungrateful,Akika zawangi ujin zanae jin yebo ya Tsociu naa
And to that fact he bears witness by his deeds,Akika wuntso zawngi ma jin ri ke wune jin yebo ya Sokoa nan
And violent is he in his love of wealth,Akika zawangi de cicin eyan bologi izhe sarauyin
 Does he not know- when that which is in the graves is scattered abroad,Beke ade kpikpe dea Kede Soko a bea san kabari zhio Baaci ajalia boa na
 And that which is locked up in human breasts is made manifest-,Efo wuncin agaa yanna fi yangban zandondoo na tula zhi fiilio
That their Lord had been Well-acquainted with them even to that Day,Akika Tsocia ayaa labari yan yan na zaeni ndoro jin nan fo wuncin
 The Day of Noise and Clamour,Sokoe zhi kuti be efona yangban halittazhi kpaata a fe ke dozhi nan

 And what will explain to thee what the Day of Noise and Clamour is,Annabi kiima ya wye kpikpe yan efo na yangban zawangizhi a fe ke dozhi nano
It is a Day whereon men will be like moths scattered about,Efo wuncin ga dabe zawangizhi gaafe ke kotonkoci boro eyan fufungizhi naaga ya nan
 And the mountains will be like carded woolPatizhi ci ga afe ke eyin na gaya nan,
Then he whose balance of good deeds will be found heavy,Zaeni ndoro na aga bea etunu man tsunwan yan etun guruzhi cia lukpin sarauyin nan
 Will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction,Sokoa ga zawuncin gba be edunfeba aljannao na wuntsoa fa yangban be yin nan
 But he whose balance of good deeds will be found light-,Zaeni ndoro naaga bea etunu man tsunwan yan etunu cia zhe tukun nan
Will have his home in a bottomless Pit,Fo wuncin Nnau naa bou nan ugayi Hawiyao

 It is a Fire Blazing fiercely!,Enan uyio na tan sarauyin nan
The mutual rivalry for piling up the good things of this world diverts you from the more serious things,Ekwoce dan wiwa enyan izheo wuna ye jin shagala ke pipa Soko be kiyamae lugwaa
